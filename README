2024.03 - model/2-Channel Tensor Spaoce Model This directory contains 2-Channel Tensor Space Model(TextCuboid) experiments proposed to improve the classification performance of TextCuboid. The 2-Channel TextCuboid (Tensor Space Model) can train semantic, context, and sequence information by utilizing the Transformer structure and TextCNN structure.
         
          => The model structure used in the Transformer classifier code is referenced in the link below.
