       " 'rio games highlight problems with the olympic model  the new york times rio de janeiro  —   proud and beautiful as this seaside city is glorious as the feats of athleticism and sportsmanship were these past two weeks these games underline that the olympic model is fractured as we depart rio de janeiro is left with stadiums for which it has little use and swimming pools far removed from the working class who could dearly use them tens of thousands of residents were displaced a golf course sits atop a former nature preserve and the towers of the athletes’ village will have a second life as luxury housing rio’s state government turns its pockets inside out looking for money to pay salaries and to keep hospitals open the army withdraws and fears rise that crime will spiral the international olympic committee has taken steps toward reform but what it demands of nations is basically unchanged build us expensive monuments with a shelf life of two weeks the i o c has no hammer to bring down when cities fail to deliver on environmental promises there is a more sustainable and less ruinous path and i will get to that first i should wrestle with the challenge tossed down by my colleague roger cohen he is an incisive humane observer and he argued that critics have the rio olympics all wrong his perspective should be reckoned with even as i disagreed with nearly every word “i am tired very tired” cohen wrote last week “of reading negative stories about these brazilian olympics  —   the anger in the slums the violence that continues including the armed robbery of four american swimmers the enduring gulf between rich and poor the occasional organizational hassles the russian doping and the brazilian mosquito money that could supposedly have been spent better ” he argued that the developed world harbors an antipathy for grand sporting events held in the developing world i would turn his formulation on its head the greatest honor we can pay to a nation is to take its maladies seriously brazil overthrew a dictatorship and remains a gloriously messy democracy yet police and paramilitary violence and human rights violations accompany its grand sporting events brazilian officials desperate to tamp down the vicious drug gangs before the olympics let the army and the police ratchet up violence to the point that last year the police committed   of the homicides in rio such problems are not unique to rio de janeiro “a major sporting event” amnesty international wrote of rio “tends to increase the human rights violations that already occur in a host city ” corruption scarred these games as contractors and politicians sluiced hundreds of millions of dollars into their coffers brave journalists here exposed this and brazilian prosecutors to their credit investigated the metastasizing scandals earlier this year the scion of the nation’s largest construction companies odebrecht an investor in the athletes’ housing was sentenced to  years in prison for his role in another political scandal we would do well to stanch any north american impulse toward   the united states walked this twisted path too our salt lake  winter olympics were a bacchanalia of bribes doping and corruption my colleague cohen claimed to detect another double standard he could recall no reporters poking around impoverished corners of london during its summer olympics if that is so that is our failure london remains one of the globe’s more grossly unequal cities and terrific activism was afoot during those olympics i recall walking through london’s east end before those games and talking with the imams bakers construction workers students and pastors who were the backbone of east london communities organization they successfully pressured the london organizers to pay living wages to all who worked inside the olympic perimeter “they said they had obligations to their contractors” lina jamoul an organizer told me at the time “we said ‘what you have is a bureaucracy that isn’t our problem ’” activists in london also applied concerted pressure to get the olympic corporation to create   units of affordable housing after the games the rio olympics offer nods toward a sustainable future the handball courts an example of nomadic architecture will be dismantled and used to build schools the media center will become dorms and sections of the olympic center could become a public park there was however no movement to ensure livable wages for workers and not a single flat in the towers where the athletes were housed will be reserved for   and poor cariocas the developers obtained the public land for free a recessionary housing market does threaten their profit margin which is a pity more to the point the loudest protests about these olympics came not from berkeley or oxford but from within rio de janeiro labor unions teachers and activists on either side of the coastal mountains that divide this city joined in marches their anger coupled with a wounded economy might account for the thousands of empty seats seen here these past two weeks “we liked the talk of the olympics at first” noted carla maria avesani who runs a respected nutrition institute at rio de janeiro’s state university which has suffered grievous cuts in pay and services “then brazilians awoke from this dream it became a nightmare ” so what’s the solution we could place the games in los angeles london or paris or seek a permanent home in athens which has historical and emotional resonance “i very much understand the i o c ’s desire to be more equitable in delivering the olympics to the developing world” said allen hershkowitz the founder of green sports international who is an environmental consultant to pro sports leagues and the olympics “but the sochi and rio olympics indicate that there are such huge environmental transportation water and   questions ” to retreat to the cities of the northern hemisphere however strikes me  —   and hershkowitz  —   as a defeat what if the i o c instead had awarded rio de janeiro three cycles of olympics   and  city officials would have time to learn and grow to ride out a bad recession and market rio as a true olympic city activists might have forced the olympics to truly integrate into the lifeblood of the city incorporating favelas no less than the beach community of barra they might have demanded that the athletes’ towers become   housing they might demand living wages and true apprenticeship programs sewage treatment plants could come on line over the course of a decade i opposed the efforts of the former mayor michael r bloomberg to bring the olympics to new york the cacophonous echo chamber that is my native city but i admired his equitable proposal to put olympic swimming pools and kayak routes in   city parks olympic officials would also possess a stick if city leaders did not offer measurable progress the i o c could withdraw the next two rounds of games such a plan offers much for prospective winter olympics sites as well argentine or chilean developers in the andes  —   or russians in sochi for that matter  —   would have time to build out   and environmentally sensitive winter sports resorts over  years cushioned by the security of olympic branding tennis’s biggest events from wimbledon to the united states french and australian opens build out their businesses in this fashion year after year the united states tennis association recently added renewable energy and recycling at flushing meadows “you can’t just do this for a   event it’s got to be a   planning” hershkowitz said “otherwise you’re left with empty stadiums and a wrecked environment ” in the end the olympics must change travel to athens or sochi and you will find a shattered vase of a model fewer and fewer cities desire that in the past few years residents of   host cities revolted and oslo and boston among other cities canceled bids to host the games i’m no dour puritan i love great athletics my heart leapt as i watched usain bolt fly down the track and simone biles spin and flip as if exempt from the laws of gravity to stand in the legendary maracanã stadium for the gold medal men’s soccer game and listen as brazilians transformed it into a joyous asylum was a wonder cariocas were gracious from copacabana baristas to an impoverished    marie auxiliadora who invited me into her home in favela do mandela to listen to her upset with these   games one day perhaps even next time we can deliver a sustainable olympics worthy of them',\n",

       " 'the subconscious decision what’s worth it  the new york times one couple one   job at the department of agriculture a couple of other gigs running a janitorial business and a   venture plus the pastor position at new jerusalem missionary baptist church in ferguson mo that’s what it takes for alonzo adams and his wife ronica to make ends meet and that’s without any money left for retirement savings but they are raising their children in a neighborhood they like better a few miles up the road in florissant mo their children they have concluded are a product of their environment so what must the couple give up now to give their children a better future “i give up the ability to have a better later” alonzo said every one of us makes money   nearly every day whether we realize it or not residence over retirement later over now needs over wants faith over financial facts but all too often these   are subconscious which means we don’t discuss them openly and fail to question them relentlessly “it’s like money is just this big blob” said sallie krawcheck a   and chief executive of ellevest an online investment service for women that tries to make these   visible “people think about it conceptually and not in terms of wanting to start a business retire well buy a house or have a baby ” the blob she concluded when she was starting her business needed clearing up “this is not money to get more money” she said “it’s money to do these things help me figure out what i can afford and when and what the   are to getting there ” the people you’ll encounter in this section have been sorting it out for themselves for some time now their household income is at or close to the median in their area meeting the most basic of needs is usually not a problem but it’s a challenge to figure out how often to allow themselves things they want and to weigh those desires against longstanding debt or the contributions they probably ought to make to their futures below are some of the most common   that they  —   and all of us  —   face most often in january  jordan hightower’s younger sister molly was killed in an earthquake while volunteering in haiti jordan soon resolved that she would end her “one day” saving mentality and focus on today that meant travel to a dozen bachelorette parties around the united states and to  countries around the world in the last seven years while she’s traveled on a hostel budget and managed   in annual retirement savings her down payment savings have suffered even as prices for starter homes in tacoma wash have risen jordan  has no regrets though a wedding and kids are on the horizon in the next few years and she plans to adjust her house savings accordingly now that she’s been able to see and do so much “i’m not worried or sad about changing those things” she said martin and raquel vergara met as rivals operating neighboring mall kiosks she eventually became a personal banker while he is a mixed martial arts fighter and a personal trainer now that they’re the parents of two small children raquel  has hit the pause button on her career to care for the kids they don’t want to miss too much time with them wondering if their hours with their children will add up to more than those of   providers “we are investing time in our kids” said martin who is  “that means more than money ” even single parents make similar decisions if they possibly can and some believe it’s necessary natalie davis was  and pregnant when her husband died unexpectedly five years ago now she has a    boy and a    girl she’s also no longer a   executive even though she ran up some   debt and sacrificed savings after her decision to work less for her the choice wasn’t a close call “they needed it” she said even though her husband did not have life insurance being with her children more often also helped clarify what counted as a mere want when it came to the family budget “sometimes my son will really want something and i used to feel guilty being that he doesn’t have his dad” she said “i used to do everything i could to get him what he wants and now i don’t stress on that anymore ” chris and tanya brashers have faced health problems landlord problems and employment problems both have declared personal bankruptcy soon they will move from bryan ark to fairhope ala they are both veterans and they are crossing their fingers that the optimistic new postal address will bring new career opportunities for chris who is  he trained as an engineer but his passion is photography and his research suggests that he will be able to get freelance work there while the couple is in debt tanya who is  professes a certain serenity about their circumstances given all they have experienced “i’ve learned not to depend on money for your happiness” she said “now living as simply as we do i’m kind of at peace ” alonzo  the minister with multiple other jobs works  to  hours each week so his children can grow up in a safe neighborhood the family has a security system but they sometimes forget to turn it on and then leave the doors unlocked nobody comes in “would i be that comfortable in another neighborhood” he said “the neighborhood where i grew up in nope ” so the family has physical security paying now so that the kids can have a better later as alonzo puts it but hanging over that   is another one that he said so many   families face “what can i leave for them” he wondered “most black people leave their families a bill when they die not a legacy not an estate we don’t have estates the only thing we know about estates is when we see the sign for estate sales and we get happy because this is a real big garage sale ” all joking aside alonzo doesn’t need to look far to see where a lack of retirement savings can get you given that his father is still a pastor at the church as well black preachers just die he said they don’t retire still at least his choice is deliberate trade a better later for himself for a better later for his children it’s the same   parents have made for centuries and it’s a swap that many parents continue to make without much hesitation read what other people are saying about

       " 'russia and the united states reach new agreement on syria conflict  the new york times geneva  —   russia and the united states agreed early saturday on a new plan to reduce violence in the syrian conflict that if successful could lead for the first time to joint military targeting by the two powers against islamic jihadists in syria the agreement was reached after  months of failed attempts to halt the fighting and of suspended efforts to reach a political settlement to an increasingly complex conflict that began more than five years ago the conflict has left nearly half a million people dead created the largest refugee crisis since world war ii and turned syria into a prime incubator of recruiting for the islamic state and the nusra front an affiliate of al qaeda secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart sergey v lavrov announced the agreement in geneva after weeks of negotiations that were marred in president obama’s words by deep “mistrust” between the russians and americans who back opposite sides in syria but share an antipathy to the islamic jihadists flourishing there it came at a time when relations between the united states and russia which have worsened throughout much of the obama administration have been especially jolted by accusations of russian hacking and subterfuge in american politics the tensions have been further exacerbated by the effusive praise for president vladimir v putin of russia by the republican presidential nominee donald j trump the new arrangement on syria set to begin monday was greeted with skepticism by syrians on all sides and carries many risks of failure which the pentagon and mr kerry acknowledged “no one is basing this on trust” he said “we are basing it on oversight and compliance ” the plan starts with a   continuous “genuine reduction of violence” in mr kerry’s words and broad unrestricted humanitarian access to the ravaged northern city of aleppo and other besieged areas if that works the united states and russia are to establish a joint implementation center where they will share targeting data and begin to coordinate bombing of militants of the nusra front and the islamic state the key element is that russia must then restrain the forces of president bashar   of syria from conducting any air operations over areas held by nusra and other opposition forces the united states hopes this will end the indiscriminate dropping of barrel bombs  —   including chlorine gas attacks  —   that have punctuated the conflict in return the united states is to persuade the opposition groups it has been supporting to separate themselves from the nusra forces mr assad has attacked many of them on the pretense of attacking nusra fighters american officials expressed strong reservations about whether this new arrangement would work especially skeptical was the pentagon long suspicious of russian intentions in syria since the kremlin first deployed military forces there to help mr assad a year ago defense secretary ashton b carter was among obama administration officials who raised questions over whether either russia or the assad government would comply with the terms mr kerry’s announcement of the deal mr lavrov at his side was permeated with caveats “we believe the plan if implemented if followed has the ability to provide a turning point a change” he said but he sounded far more cautious here than he did in munich in february when he announced an earlier “cessation of hostilities” that failed the accord was reached after sharp divisions inside the obama administration over the wisdom of sharing targeting information with russia and accusations that the russians have used the negotiating period to help mr assad regain control in aleppo and strike at   opposition groups for mr obama who asked mr kerry to keep working on the negotiation after the president failed to reach an accord with mr putin during the group of  summit meeting in china last weekend the new accord poses considerable risks for example if the bombing of nusra sites kills civilians  —   almost inevitable given the proximity of militant extremist groups and civilians  —   there are bound to be accusations about who is responsible pentagon officials are also concerned that russia will use the targeting data to learn more about how american forces identify and attack targets at a time when forces from the two countries are often near one another around europe mr lavrov took a few shots at the united states even while celebrating the arrangement denouncing “arrogant sanctions” levied against russia for its annexation of crimea two years ago late on friday he suggested the united states could not decide about the deal sending pizza and vodka to reporters to ease the wait and coming by to joke about how long it took mr obama and his team to make decisions but for mr kerry reaching this deal has become a personal mission one that at times put him in conflict with the white house he has pressed for a stronger military commitment in syria and support for some opposition groups along with a series of more aggressive covert actions according to administration officials mr obama has been reluctant as have others in the white house who fear that even if they could engineer a transition in syria it could create a power vacuum that iran russia and militant terrorist groups could exploit the american skepticism is partly rooted in the failed agreement for a cessation of hostilities reached with the russians in february that arrangement collapsed weeks later when russia moved heavy artillery into the aleppo area to help mr assad’s forces among the syrians the latest plan was greeted with wariness particularly from armed opposition groups and their supporters who broadly speaking have come to believe that the united states has lost interest in ousting mr assad and is willing to see them wiped out it is a measure of how little trust the syrians have in the international community  —   especially after the     in february  —   that initial reactions were lukewarm even though the deal holds out the possibility of at least a temporary calming of the violence armed opposition groups read the deal as ordering them to remove   nusra fighters from their areas something they lack the military power to do alone or else face attack by the united states  —   a country that has provided some of the rebel groups with training and weapons for years some government opponents noted that the deal came hours after syrian military forces  —   with russian air support  —     their siege of the   sections of aleppo while mr kerry began his announcement by noting that mr assad’s airstrikes were as he put it “the main driver of civilian casualties and migration flows” the deal  —   as partly described  —   contains many loopholes that could allow them to continue and no measures were described that would hold any of the parties to account if they violated the terms of a deal that is being struck at a time when the united states has little leverage over russia in syria the deal allows syrian government warplanes to continue to fly missions in some areas that are to be defined later and russia and the united states will target areas where they both agree nusra or islamic state fighters are present what that really means hinges on how russia and the united states define legitimate opposition groups that cannot be targeted under the deal and how they define areas where nusra is present the deal also failed to mention anything about the presence of foreign shiite militias  —   such as hezbollah which like al qaeda and islamic state is considered a terrorist group by the united states  —   fighting on the syrian government’s side it also said nothing about the tens of thousands of detainees in syrian government prisons whose release had long been touted as a possible measure under a deal and while it spoke of allowing aid deliveries into besieged areas it said nothing of lifting the sieges and restoring freedom of movement of goods and people',\n",

       " 'trump’s wiretapping claims puncture veneer of presidential civility  the new york times washington  —   when last they saw each other six weeks ago after the ceremonial passing of power president trump and former president barack obama parted with smiles and handshakes but it did not take long for the surface bonhomie to degenerate into a fierce and public clash unlike any other in modern times while mr obama has remained quiet for the most part some of his closest loyalists moved into opposition mode leading what some only   call “the resistance ” mr trump convinced that obama holdovers still in government are trying to sabotage his presidency took the conflict nuclear over the weekend by accusing his predecessor of bugging his telephones last year mr trump provided no proof and the charge was quickly dismissed by intelligence veterans and indirectly the f b i but that did not make it any less sensational or any less historic never in recent generations has the natural friction between current and past presidents spilled over into such a public spectacle if sustained it could fray the institution of the presidency further erode the public’s already low confidence in the nation’s leadership and leave both allies and enemies with the impression of an america at war with itself perhaps it should be no surprise that it came to this between the th and th presidents during last year’s campaign mr obama called mr trump a “con artist and a  ” who could not be trusted with the nuclear codes mr trump called mr obama “the worst president in the history of the united states” after spending years questioning whether he had been born in the united states they put that rancor aside for a cordial meeting after the election but that barely veiled the chasm between them in terms of personality politics and policy “we’re in a unique period” said newt gingrich the republican former house speaker who has been an outside adviser to the new president “trump is a genuinely disruptive figure who threatens everything obama stands for ” mr obama’s camp insisted they are simply defending their legacy “it takes two people to duel and only one seems to be aiming his weapon” said jennifer psaki white house communications director under mr obama “the uniqueness of the time is the fact that you have one unhinged and misinformed sitting president pointing his gun at a former that is unprecedented ” denis r mcdonough mr obama’s last white house chief of staff said the former president’s team could not remain silent in the face of false assertions “what i have witnessed in recent days is former colleagues speaking out against untruths when needed” he said “that is best characterized as not backing down from attacks it is not seeking out conflict ” but inside the trump white house it has become an article of faith that people seeded throughout the government by mr obama have been leaking everything they could get their hands on to damage the new president “i think that president obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it” mr trump said in a recent interview with “fox  friends ” “and some of the leaks possibly come from that group you know some of the leaks which are really very serious leaks because they’re very bad in terms of national security ” other presidents have endured fractious relations after leaving office herbert hoover regularly castigated franklin d roosevelt who ostracized his predecessor harry s truman was so estranged from dwight d eisenhower that they did not speak during a frosty ride to the  inauguration ronald reagan publicly blamed his woes on the mess he said jimmy carter had left him just as mr obama from time to time pointed the finger at george w bush but none of those moments compared to what america has seen in recent days “trump is on new ground in going after obama” said the historian robert dallek who has written acclaimed books on john f kennedy lyndon b johnson and richard m nixon most presidents have publicly ignored their predecessors “until we get to trump” he added “he is either ignorant of recent presidential history or simply doesn’t care ” the closest analogue in modern times may have been johnson and nixon both presidents who favored secret wiretapping in his last days in office johnson was furious at nixon after wiretaps revealed that a republican intermediary seemed to be trying to undercut possible peace talks before the  election for his part nixon was convinced that johnson had bugged him yet neither johnson nor nixon publicly aired those grievances at the time “the nixon tapes show that nixon always thought that johnson taped his  campaign and possibly nixon himself” said luke a nichter a leading scholar of nixon’s secret oval office tapes at texas am university “nixon said that it was j edgar hoover who told him this however based on the available records the closest to wiretapping nixon that l b j ever came was monitoring the phone calls out of spiro agnew’s campaign plane ” before last year’s campaign mr obama told advisers that he was inclined to keep quiet after leaving office to give his successor a chance to govern much as mr bush did for him but he expected that successor to be hillary clinton or even jeb bush or marco rubio mr trump was a different story and mr obama concluded he would speak out if he felt the nation’s ideals were under threat ten days into the new administration when mr trump issued his first temporary travel ban on visitors from seven largely muslim countries and cited mr obama’s own actions as precedent the former president did just that in a statement saying he “fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion ” his team did not wait even that long the day after the inauguration former obama administration officials including john kerry whose tenure as secretary of state had just ended joined a women’s march in washington protesting mr trump other officials appeared on television talk shows and newspaper   pages to speak out against the new president’s policies mr trump’s team has been angered by the criticism but even more by what they see as the enemy within with so few of his own political appointees in place much of the government is still operating with acting officials some held over from the obama administration moreover the federal civil service while officially neutral politically is not dominated by trump supporters judging by vote results in washington and its suburbs so when mark levin the conservative radio host contended that mr obama had targeted mr trump for surveillance in what he called a “silent coup” an assertion picked up by breitbart news the former website of the white house chief strategist stephen k bannon it struck a chord along with reports that in mr obama’s last days in office his administration changed the rules on distributing intelligence and made a point of spreading information about mr trump’s team and russia to different parts of the government to “preserve” it the wiretapping allegation pushed mr trump over the top “it’s a sign of how deeply frustrated he is” mr gingrich said “they have a much bigger assault against them than people have had in the past ” and so mr gingrich added mr trump needs to figure out how to get control of his own bureaucracy “he’s not going to survive” he said “unless he profoundly rethinks what they’re doing and how they’re doing it ”',\n",

all elections we have information which shocks us to the core freezes our hearts and sends chills shuddering through our spines ladies and gentlemen the problem is not fbigate it is the mechanisms behind the scenes which have not been reported read on first off how many times has president obama blocked investigation into hillary clintons affairs you will never know you will never ever know because the system is rigged there is no paper trail there are telephone calls there are meetings behind closed doors there are threats this time however obama was caught by surprise the nobel peace prizewinner the one who insulted the nobel institution the international community and all those who believed in his shitfaced lie change the one who blasted libya from the african country with the highest human development index back to the stone age riddled with terrorists including islamic state the one who stood back as islamic state appeared under his nose this one this time was unable to stop an fbi investigation because it happened behind his back trying to get at the truth print version font size ladies and gentlemen this truth will not come out in the next few days for those with their political knives aglistening and agleaming behind hillarys back waiting for some knockout soundbites from those documents it is not going to happen not because the fbi investigation failed to unveil juicy stuff but because that juicy stuff will never reach the public domain obamageddon to the rescue fbigate quashed and while fbigate is quashed watch what happens behind the scenes with the electoral system george soros is firmly in the clinton camp so they say does anyone know how many states use electronic voting systems run by george soros does anyone know how easy it is to hack or rig these voting machines these machines churn out votes there is no accountability there is no paper trail the vote will not be verified there will be numbers statistics the day after rigged this is american democracy the collective answer is no the collective response is we all know this is true we all know this is happening nobody likes hillary nobody trusts hillary so why vote for her investigating fbigate now lets see what my friend nancy obrien simpson turned up she lives in the united states of america she is a political commentator and she is a political activist secretary clinton fell for the oldest hack in the book this hack entails something called the buffer overflow exploit that involves stacking a malicious computer virus in an area on your hard drive where virus protection software cant find them then it steals the files from the hard drive a friend of mine who has been on the wrong side of these kinds of situations explained what he has read about how it all went down huma and anthony are sharing a laptop at their home huma receives classified information from her boss hillary clinton in various emails and texts she testified to the fbi that she often emailed classified files over her unsecured yahoo account in order to print them out at home on the laptop she shared with her husband antony when huma goes to bed carlos danger sneaks out in his pajammies and prowls chan all night looking for young teen girls to send them naked photos one of these photos contains a computer virus that infects the laptop this virus hides in photographs stored on a computers hard drive by exploiting a photos bandwidth when the recipient receives photos in return the photos contain information from the computer it has infested the ironic part is every time carlos danger send photos of his wiener his nasty photos contained all the emails his wife received from hillary as well as the classified documents she printed out this means some hackers out there on the net has everything huma brought home if the hackers are white hat they probably told the fbi to examine every one of carlos dangers nasty photos he sent over that laptop if the hackers are black hats you can bet some foreign government has a lot of classified documents the clinton crime family will blame the russians which is laughable and serious at the same time you know they reopened the investigation behind obamas back because he has blocked the investigation of her at every turn i heard the rank and file fbi were about to mutiny because they know she is guilty as sin and comey would not prosecute because she is protected by obama and clinton gave his wife half a million for her political campaign this might be big but obama will stop it to protect her and his globalist

       " 'confirmed washington insider responsible for clinton “hit job”  conservative daily post \\nposted by matthew bernstein  nov    american strength washington not russia was responsible \\nif you are been paying attention to what the democrats are saying this election in terms of the hacks they will tell you that it’s all part of a plot that involves donald trump and russia every top democrat from hillary clinton to barack obama has argued that \\nthey have been saying this ever since the first hacks on the democratic national committee happened back in july and they have continued that claim with every hack that has happened since most recently they have been saying that the hacks on clinton’s campaign chairman john podesta were part of yet another russian hack \\nthey have claimed that the hacks were done in order to influence the election in favor of trump not everyone believes that lie in fact there are people out there that think that the source of the hack has come from the united states government \\none person that believes that is former british ambassador craig murray he says that the source of the podesta leaks was a washington insider rather than someone from russia that would mean that clinton’s campaign is continuing to make a false claim on a foreign country \\nmurray told sputnik “the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adam’s whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow” \\nthat means that there is someone in washington that is doing what he or she can to end the corruption of the clintons and yet her camp continues to claim that someone within russia did it because that is a phenomenal way to create peace between two nations that have nuclear weapons someone in washington is trying to make sure hillary doesn’t win \\nbut that wasn’t the only thing that murray went on to destroy he went on to blast the democrats other narrative that wikileaks is a source for russia he has said that such claims are “designed to divert attention from the content of the material” that means that they are hiding something if they are spending this much time trying to change the story \\nwikileaks also decided to mock the clinton campaign’s literal obsession with conspiracy theories with a tweet they said “no link between trump  russia no link between assange  russia but podesta  clinton involved in selling  of us uranium to russia” \\nthis tweet was in reference to the fact that the fbi found nothing of substance that connected donald trump to russia they literally said that he had “no clear link to russia” so once again the democrats attempt to say something like that is proven false \\nthat also means that if the democrats continue to blame trump for this supposed russian hack on their servers then they are definitely hiding something because the fbi has cleared trump of any connection to russia and now there is a former british ambassador that has said that the hacks were coming from someone located in washington \\nand there are other claims to back that up there was a youtube video that was released and has gone viral in it former deputy assistant secretary of state steve pieczenik is talking about how there are people in the united states government are doing what they can to prevent clinton from becoming president of the united states \\nhe has said that members of the united states government including the fbi and the cia have “initiated a countercoup through julian assange and wikileaks in order to stop hillary clinton from becoming president of the united states” pieczenik has also said that assange has released “emails that we gave to him in order to undermine hillary and bill clinton” \\nthat is two former high ranking members of their respective governments saying that the leak has come from washington and not russia like the democrats want you to believe but it goes even further than that what murray has said is true they are doing whatever they can to have the people of the united states not look at those emails that were released the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks because that is a great foreign policy tactic \\nthat is because those emails have shown that the democrats are engaging in some highly illegal activity from all the leaks that we have seen the democrats have engaged in election rigging paytoplay operations and cheating in several different debates but of course when you try and confront them on this they will attempt to say that russia was behind it or that trump was behind it \\none of the excuses that they have also given has come from interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile during the second hack of the dnc back in july she attempted to scare people from reading the hacked emails by saying that they could possibly be infected with malware  really if you are making this big an attempt to stop people from reading them then you are obviously hiding something \\nof course brazile was mentioned in those wikileaks emails as well she was guilty of giving clinton a question that was going to appear in a town hall and when someone called her out on it brazile attempted to say that she was being “ persecuted ” it’s not persecution if the answer is right in front of you you were literally doing what you could to help out clinton as much as possible \\nshare this article to show that there are people out there that believe that the hacks on the democratic party are coming from washington itself rather than russia and considering that the democrats continue to blame russia for the hacks means that they are just damaging the foreign relationships even more \\nthat is not something that the united states can afford anymore we need people that are going to work on making our relationships with foreign governments better not worse we also need people that are going to lead the people and not have to answer to more corruption charges this is why we need donald trump ',\n",

email revelations  we learned that sheik mohammed hussein ali al‘amoudi  a saudi arabian and ethiopian billionaire businessman whose net worth was estimated by forbes at  billion as of  was one of the very generous donors to the clinton foundation… up to a point\\nas a november  email from ira magaziner vice chairman and ceo of the clinton health access initiative sent to john podesta and amitabh desai director of foreign policy at the clinton foundation revealed the “chai clinton health access initiative would like to request that president clinton call sheik mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in ethiopia and expressing regrets that president clinton’s schedule does not permit him to attend the conference”\\nto this the response by desai was a simple one “ unless sheikh mo has sent us a  million check this sounds crazy to do ”\\nat this point doug band bill clinton’s former chief advisor and current president of the infamous teneo holding doug band chimed in that it probably is a good idea “if he doesn’t do it chai will say he didn’t give the money bc of wjc” an assessment which john podesta agreed with “this seems rather easy and harmless and not a big time sink”\\n  \\nto be sure this exchange suggested that a substantial amount of cash had or was about to be exchanged between the clinton foundation and the saudi “sheikh mo” as shown in the photo below\\n\\nhowever the details were missing the original email from ira magaziner referenced a specific briefing memo which contained in it the talking points updating on the relationship between the clinton foundation and the saudi billionaire\\ned wood has prepared a briefing memo for president clinton about the call which is attached\\nnow courtesy of today’s latest podesta email release we have access to the missing memo \\nthe leaked memo lays out the facts on the clinton foundation trying to collect on sheik mohammed’s overdue donor commitment to chai notably the memo gives the inference of the sheik being shaken down by the foundation in that the foundation was demanding an immediate  million payment in return for wjc attending the  international conference on aids and stis icasa event additionally the foundation apparently enlisted the assistance of the us ambassador to ethiopia to obtain payments from the sheik\\nthe memo initially lays out bill clinton’s history with the sheik\\nin the first bullet point we find what the initial “bid” and “ask” would be between wjccf and the saudi billionaire  million for every year that bill clinton visit ethiopia this however was subsequently changed to an agreement whereby the saudi would give  million per year but without any reference to visiting ethiopia\\nsheik mohammed approached chai in  shortly after we opened an office in addis ababa he proposed that he would give  million to chai every year that you visited ethiopia  we eventually negotiated an agreement with his washington attorney george salem in which he agreed to fund chai at a rate of  million per year for  years  they rejected any proposals to put a payment schedule in the agreement but dropped any reference tying the donation to you visiting ethiopia \\nthe next bullet lays out the initial fund transfer of  million in london as well as the broad terms of the agreement whose “requirement is that the money be spent within ethiopia” amusingly the memo then notes that during negotiations the saudi delegation “rejected our proposal that some of the money could be used for global overhead ”\\nthe agreement was officially signed at a meeting in london in may  by the sheik and bruce after which the sheik presented you with a a check for  million for the  payment the agreement is very general and does not require any specific proposals from chai for how the money will be spent or any reporting the only requirement is that the money be spent within ethiopia during negotiations they rejected our proposal that some of the money could be used for global overhead\\nwe then learn that more cash transfers took place in the coming years despite the sheik having “cash flow problems” which resulted in a bulk payment of  million in  for missed payments in  and \\nthrough  and early  we were told the sheik was having some cash flow problems and that he was delaying payments for many commercial and philanthropic commitments he had in ethiopia in january  at a foundation donors meeting in harlem ambassador irvin hicks one of the sheik’s representatives in the us and a former ethiopian ambassador appointed by you presented to you a check for  million representing payment for  and  \\nthe memo then tells wjc just why the relationship was created in the first place “the sheik’s contribution supports most of chai’s activities in ethiopia one of its most important and successful country programs”\\na section then follow which reminds bill clinton just who sheikh mohammed is and that the two had spent time together in his “private suite at a nightclub attached to the sheraton” in addis ababa ethiopia\\nyou first met the sheik in july  during a visit to addis he visited your suite in the sheraton hotel which he owns for coffee and then after dinner you dropped into his private suite at a nightclub attached to the sheraton he had invited you there especially because he thought you would enjoy the saxophone player  you chatted with the sheik and played the saxophone with the band shortly after this visit negotiations began in earnest regarding the  million commitment the sheik has made to chai \\nyou met the sheik in london in may  at which time the agreement was signed and the first  million check was received\\nyou stayed at the sheraton in july  during your last ethiopia visit but the sheik was not in ethiopia at the time the sheik donated the rooms and meals for the large party during an extended fourday visit two days longer than originally planned because of aircraft problems \\nwhere things get interesting is in the memo’s discussion of the current as of november  situation in which we learn that once again the saudi billionaire was behind on his payments due to the current economic downturn\\nonce again we are told that the current economic down turn has caused the sheik to delay payments for several commitments chai has not received the  or  payments  we have contacted both george salem the lawyer and ambassador hicks regarding payment both say that the sheik will make the payment but they have not been able to pinpoint an exact date\\nrecent complications did not make matters any easier although the sheikh had enough cash to provide bill with a plane to attend the upcoming african aids conference\\nin the past two months the effort to collect the payments for  has become complicated by factors surrounding icasa the biennial large african aids conference that will be held in ethiopia the first week of december the previous two icasa conference in nigeria and senegal were beset by logistical and financial problems and prime minister meles and minister of health tedros have worked hard to make the ethiopia icasa the most successful ever they have enlisted sheik mohammed to help and he has donated the venue and paid for an additional  million of expenses\\nminister tedros invited you to participate in icasa and apparently he or someone else connected with icasa asked the sheik if he would provide a plane to bring you to ethiopia for the event the sheik agreed to provide a plane and instructed ambassador hicks to tell chai one would be available \\nwhere things get hot and where the clinton foundation is accused of “coercion” by the sheik’s washington attorney george salem is in the negotiation over whether clinton should come to ethiopia without having been wired the funds up front or if he should assume that the billionaire is “good for the money” and just fly out there on good will\\nwhen george salem spoke with the sheik about the payment he was told by the sheik to make sure you knew that the sheik would very much like for you to attend icasa and that he would provide transportation in response bruce told george that if the sheik would wire  million to the foundation for  that he would make sure you attended icasa after bruce’s stroke george told ed wood of chai that the sheik said he did not like “coercion” and that we should know that he was “good for the money ” george reiterated that the money would be paid but could not give a date\\nthe sheik seems to feel that we asked him for transportation and then decided not to use it george and ambassador hicks have been told that the request for transportation did not originate with us but we are not sure that the message reached the sheik\\nultimately the negotiations for clinton flying to ethiopia stalled and appear to have fallen apart leading to the original quote from the clinton foundation’s amitabh desai in which he said as we noted earlier this month that “ unless sheikh mo has sent us a  million check this sounds crazy to do ” as a result the memo gives wjc the following action point\\ngeorge salem ambassador hicks and chai feel that it would be helpful if you would call the sheik and thank him for offering the plane and saying you are sorry you can’t attend icasa we don’t think it is necessary for you to bring up the payment issue directly\\nthe memo concludes with the following talking points\\nyou should thank the sheik for his support of all our efforts in ethiopia and especially for offering to provide a plane to bring you to the icasa meeting you should express your regrets that you were not able to arrange your schedule to attend the icasa meeting since you know how important it is to ethiopia and to the sheik you should express your appreciation that he has helped make this event possible during a difficult time for the international aids effort you should say you hope to be able to visit with the sheik again soon either in ethiopia or elsewhere   \\nthis memo provides valuable insight into just how the “charitable” clinton foundation truly operated absent being made whole on millions of dollars in payments – by a donor who had already provided it with  million in the past – the “so very concerned” about aids and african welfare foundation would not even bother to fly bill clinton for a  day trip – on someone else’s dime – to something as simple yet noble as a healthcare conference precisely what the foundation and bill clinton’s presence is supposed to represent and support\\nit also shows that when the foundation found itself in arrears to a prominent donor it first and only concern was how to get paid all else – up to and including doing the absolute minimum such as appearing for a good cause was secondary and – as the memo documents – ultimately irrelevant unless clinton and the cf were both generously compensated for their efforts\\nand that in a nutshell is what the “generous and charitable” clinton foundation was all about make sure to get the money the rest simply did not matter\\nthe full hacked memo is below and the source email can be found here  \\nwjc

       " 'scrutiny of hillary clinton’s health puts new focus on tim kaine  the new york times dayton ohio  —   when hillary clinton was searching for a running mate she made clear her top criterion her selection needed to be ready to become president “if something were to happen” as she put it when she announced senator tim kaine of virginia as her choice mrs clinton affirmed that he had passed that test now after mrs clinton had to be helped into a van while departing a sept  anniversary ceremony on sunday and the later disclosure that she had been given a pneumonia diagnosis on friday mr kaine is coming under a more intense spotlight when he took questions from reporters on monday cable news channels carried the exchange live a rare level of attention for his candidacy while everyone  —   politicians included  —   gets sick from time to time the intense focus on mrs clinton’s health brings with it a constitutional reminder mr kaine is not only a   booster but also a possible president himself the scrutiny of mrs clinton’s health “means that tim kaine has to step up his game” said douglas brinkley a presidential historian at rice university “he’s such an unknown quantity to the american people that he now has to kind of assume the mantle of what it would be like to have him as commander in chief not just vice president” mr brinkley said nine vice presidents have assumed the presidency during a president’s term eight because of a death and one because of a resignation in four of those eight instances the president was assassinated in four other cases the president died of natural causes most recently in  when franklin d roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage and harry s truman became president a lawyer by training mr kaine who served as mayor of richmond va and as virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor before winning election to the senate in  was seen as an appealing pick for mrs clinton in large part because of his résumé and his policy chops but he is not a   figure nationally even after more than seven weeks as mrs clinton’s running mate in a   poll conducted this month  percent of voters said they had never heard of mr kaine and an additional  percent said they had no opinion of him “so far this has been a presidential race that has been heavily focused on the presidential candidates to an unusual extent” said joel k goldstein a law professor at st louis university who is an expert on the vice presidency recalling his own bout with pneumonia mr goldstein cautioned that “the fact that somebody has pneumonia doesn’t mean there’s about to be a succession ” but he said the episode on sunday would bring more attention to mr kaine’s suitability to the presidency “it should remind people of the importance of the two   candidates and whether they are appropriate presidential successors based on their experience skill character and substantive views” he said as he hopscotches from state to state mr kaine comes across more as a genial traveling salesman for the   ticket than as a president in waiting in his speeches he tends to focus on making a case against donald j trump while talking up mrs clinton at times he still expresses shock that he is even on the democratic ticket as if he had been plucked from anonymity to embark upon a great adventure “i felt like i was pinocchio turning into a real boy” he told a crowd in virginia on friday recalling when mrs clinton asked him to be her running mate “i mean like ‘wow what you want me are you kidding ’” the biggest test of mr kaine’s readiness will come on oct  when he faces mr trump’s running mate gov mike pence of indiana in the   debate “you don’t want a sarah palin situation where voters really have doubts about the second person on the ticket” said julian e zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton “it’s especially true if there are any kinds of concerns about age or health ” mr kaine  differs from the man he is hoping to succeed vice president joseph r biden jr in that he is a relatively new member of the senate not an elder statesman but mr kaine has made a point of focusing on foreign policy during his time in the senate where he serves on the armed services and foreign relations committees speaking to reporters after an event here on monday mr kaine said he did not think the new episode involving mrs clinton’s health put any more pressure on him to convince voters he is ready to be president even before the latest incident mr kaine had tried to defend mrs clinton against questions about her health while also calling on mr trump who had accused mrs clinton of lacking stamina to be more forthcoming about his own health two weeks ago mr kaine mocked the letter from a doctor for mr trump that asserted the candidate would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” while he also declared mrs clinton to be “one tough and one healthy person ” and as he campaigned here on monday he offered fresh testimony about mrs clinton’s physical   “i’ve just been on the campaign since july ” mr kaine told the crowd “hillary clinton has been on the campaign trail for  months her energy staggers me i have a hard time keeping up with her ”',\n",

       " 'republicans land a punch on health care to their own face  the new york times washington  —   at the end of the long day the alliance of conservative ideologues who once shut down the government over president barack obama’s health care law could not find the will to repeal it since the tea party wave of  that swept house republicans into power a raucous intransigent and loosely aligned group of lawmakers known as the freedom caucus  —   most from heavily republican districts  —   has often landed a punch to its own party’s face friday’s defeat of the republican leadership’s bill to repeal the affordable care act was a return to form handing an immense defeat to president trump and embarrassing speaker paul d ryan in his own house it also challenged the veracity of their   claims that a republican president was all they needed to get big things accomplished the most important question for republicans now is whether the members of the freedom caucus will find themselves newly emboldened in ways that may bring the new president more defeats  —   or whether mr ryan will do what former speaker john a boehner could not and find a way to shred their influence for good “if you are defined by your opposition to leadership it’s hard to be part of a governing coalition” said alex conant a onetime aide to senator marco rubio the florida republican who was once a tea party star “their opposition to trump’s health care bill should surprise nobody who’s paid attention for the last six years even the world’s best negotiator can’t make a deal with someone who never compromises ” but the freedom caucus has never been about compromise in  it picked a huge costly fight over planned parenthood in  it orchestrated a government shutdown over funding for the health care law then in its most striking move it deposed mr boehner in  the common thread it has continuously been an adversary of legislation itself but after years of opposing power  —   both in the white house which was occupied by a democrat and in the leadership of their own party  —   the conservatives were offered a chance to negotiate directly with the president and his budget director a former freedom caucus member over the bill to replace the affordable care act the members pushed and pushed mr trump to the far right edges of policy just as they have done for years on other bills but they still could not get to “yes” and therefore became part owners of the expansive health law they were trying to undo “they made the perfect the enemy of the good” said representative roger marshall republican of kansas “i don’t know how they can go back home and tell people they voted to keep obamacare voted to keep funding planned parenthood ” indeed members of the freedom caucus  —   which is supported by outside conservative groups  —   have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive time after time they undermined republican leaders’ efforts to secure wins for the conservative cause by overreaching and demanding the impossible they have anointed representative mark meadows of north carolina as their leader and principal spokesman but they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause ted cruz of texas rand paul of kentucky and mike lee of utah at critical times house conservatives have forced their party to make deals with representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leader  —   an idea anathema to most republicans who would seethe this time by negotiating with mr trump on the complex issue of health care a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board even mr trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things republicans have long promised to keep like health insurance benefits for children up to  years old given that the house and senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace mr obama’s signature health care law many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions “it is painfully ironic that members from safe conservative congressional districts who can’t ever quite seem to get to ‘yes’ make it harder to enact good conservative public policy like repealing obamacare” said michael steel a republican strategist and former aide to mr boehner this seemed lost on many freedom caucus members on friday “part of the legislative process is working with people who have different ideas” said representative justin amash republican of michigan “this process from the beginning wasn’t designed to do that ” now health care has become such a partisan issue that voters seem to have little expectation that their elected officials will do much to solve the problem “i believe we should have more attention paid to the centrists in both parties” said representative ileana   republican of florida one of the early moderate defectors of the bill “instead of showing all this attention to three or four people who never vote for anything let’s do an american health plan not a republican or democrat one ” mr ryan and mr trump offered up a cheerful patina on what many in washington viewed as an unmitigated failure one brought on by a group that had brought down the speaker shuttered the government and needlessly delayed previous legislation with no significant accomplishments to call its own and a new test will come soon as republicans contemplate an overhaul of the tax code as the fate of the health care bill throws into doubt whether any major legislation can pass in this climate to mitigate this issue mr ryan will be charged with building the sort of outside coalitions that did not exist for the failed health care bill which was opposed by doctors nurses hospitals disease groups and conservative political action committees “there are lessons from this debate that will be applied to upcoming issues like tax reform infrastructure and financial reform” said ken spain who served as the national republican congressional committee’s spokesman in  “debates are won and lost in the districts and states not in the cloakrooms of congress ” “winning legislative battles today” he said “requires more of an   approach ”',\n",

rolled up and declaring himself “fired up” on her behalf mr obama heaped admiration on mrs clinton and assailed mr trump the presumptive republican nominee saying american voters face a critical choice between “some imaginary past or whether we are going to reach for the future ” “i can tell you this hillary clinton has been tested” mr obama said as he interrupted repeatedly by the cheering crowd “there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office” the president boomed but the jubilant rally  —   mr obama’s first campaign appearance with mrs clinton  —   unfolded at an awkward moment just hours after the f b i director james b comey accused mrs clinton of being “extremely careless” in her email use as he announced the end of an investigation that has engulfed her candidacy and put the obama administration on the defensive the dueling political events on tuesday were as discordant as they were separate the president and his   secretary of state sidestepped the email issue at their rally where mr obama clasped hands with his onetime rival and predicted victory in the fall making no mention of mr comey’s dramatic announcement in washington faulting mrs clinton even as he recommended against criminal charges without mentioning the email controversy mr obama pointed to the political attacks that have chipped away at mrs clinton’s trust among voters “can i be blunt” he said “hillary’s got her share of critics ” but he added “that’s what happens when you dedicate yourself to public service over a lifetime ” mr obama delicately touched on mrs clinton’s perceived weaknesses as a candidate even as he marveled at her tenacity in the nominating fight they waged against each other eight years ago in an election year in which outsider candidates have railed against the establishment mr obama portrayed mrs clinton’s   experience as a plus “sometimes we take somebody who has been in the trenches and fought the good fight and been so steady for granted” he said recognizing that voters’ yearning for the next new thing had helped his own  campaign “we don’t do that by the way for airline pilots ” at a time when her state department tenure is being picked apart by political critics he defended her turn as the nation’s top diplomat noting how her popularity faded only once she returned to the political spotlight “it’s funny how the filter changes a little bit” he said “the filter is a powerful thing ” mrs clinton perched on a stool behind the president grinned and gently nodded the   rally in north carolina was rescheduled after a previous campaign event in wisconsin was hastily canceled after the orlando shootings but in some ways the moment had been years in the making eight years ago after a brutal primary fight mrs clinton appeared arm in arm with mr obama for the first time in unity n h where she declared “unity is not only a beautiful place it’s a wonderful feeling isn’t it” mr obama referred to that event at tuesday’s rally in north carolina a rally that served as a kind of bookend to two remarkable careers that at times seemed destined to clash “we went to unity n h just in case people missed the point” mr obama said “i saw the grace and the energy with which she threw herself into my campaign ” mrs clinton spoke before the president an unusual departure from how she appears at events with   surrogates and at times it felt like she was campaigning not for herself but for mr obama’s legacy praising his “heart depth and humility ” she repeatedly referred to their former rivalry even praising mr obama’s political deftness at defeating her “he knows a thing or two about winning elections take it from me” she said the f b i ’s decision not to recommend criminal charges came days after an unplanned brief meeting between former president bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch at an airport in phoenix to avoid any appearance of political interference ms lynch said friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the f b i director on whether to bring charges against mrs clinton on saturday mrs clinton and her lawyers met with officials

investigation on the flight to charlotte a spokesman for mrs clinton nick merrill added that mr obama looked at photos of mrs clinton’s grandchildren aboard air force one serving as mr obama’s secretary of state mrs clinton engendered good will with the white house and the experience of accepting mr obama’s offer to run the state department became one of the most popular stories she relayed on the campaign trail particularly when wooing black voters mrs clinton also fired away at mr trump saying that mr obama was “someone who has never forgotten where he came from  —   and donald if you’re out there tweeting it’s hawaii” a reference to mr trump’s calls in  for the president to produce his birth certificate for several attendees many of whom waited for hours in sweltering conditions to get into the rally the chief draw was the chance to glimpse mr obama as he sets off on something of a farewell tour the crowd was heavily   flashing clothing and trinkets dedicated to the sitting president vendors sold tote bags and   emblazoned with images of mr obama’s teenage daughters and   promising to continue mr obama’s historic  victory by electing the first female president “it was on my bucket list” ivy dunn  said of seeing him asked if she thought mrs clinton could be as effective in office ms dunn paused “i’m not going to say yes” she said “but she’ll be

muhammad ali at a memorial service on friday tens of thousands of people lined the streets of his hometown chanting “ali” and throwing flowers as a hearse carried his body to a cemetery to be laid to rest there were no barriers to keep people off the street and they swarmed forward tossing flowers onto the hearse a gently chaotic decorum prevailed riding with the windows down people in the limousines accompanying the hearse  —   including members of the ali family the actor will smith and the mayor greg fischer  —   slapped hands with the spectators as they passed the procession more celebratory than somber past his pink boyhood home and the museum and conference center that bear his name wove  miles through the city to cave hill cemetery where ali who died last week at age  was buried in a private service “muhammad wants young people to know that adversity can make you stronger” his wife lonnie said later at a memorial service packed with dignitaries taking stock of his bouts in and out of the ring “it cannot rob you of the power to reach your dreams ” she added “it is far more difficult to sacrifice oneself in the name of peace than to take up arms in the name of violence ” at a time of controversy over police shootings of young black people lonnie ali recalled that muhammad ali got into boxing at the age of  after his bicycle was stolen a white police officer taking the report suggested he learn to fight if he wanted to confront the person who took it “america must never forget when a cop and an inner city kid talk to each other miracles can happen” she said president bill clinton alluded to ali’s long fight with parkinson’s disease recalling the  summer olympics in atlanta when ali with trembling arms from the ailment lit the torch to open the games “besides being a lot of fun to be around and being a universal soldier for our common humanity i will always think of him as a truly free man of faith and being a man of faith he realized he’d never be in full control of his life’’ clinton said “something like parkinson’s could come along but being free he realized that life was still open to choices it’s the choices that muhammad ali made that brought us all here today in honor and love ” before they spoke a diverse group of religious leaders at a memorial service later offered prayers remembrances of ali and at times pointed political remarks the rev kevin cosby of st stephen church in louisville took note of the racial pride ali instilled in african americans particularly during the civil rights struggles of the s and s “he dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves” he said “he dared to affirm the beauty of blackness he dared to affirm the power and the capacity of   he dared to love america’s most unloved race ” drawing rousing cheers rabbi michael lerner the editor of tikkun magazine and a liberal activist declared in what appeared to be a reference to   rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail “we will not allow politicians to put down muslims to blame muslims for a few people ” long before the remarks and eulogies by other speakers including president bill clinton billy crystal and bryant gumbel the motorcade offered a chance for ali to be cheered and honored in the city where he grew up and never seemed to forget some of ali’s opponents joined in on broadway in downtown louisville people were startled to see larry holmes who beat ali in february  being led along the sidewalk outside the brown hotel with a young man at his elbow mr holmes smiled and said little as he shook hands and handed out signed picture cards   lined up eight and  deep along both sides of broadway stretching for blocks office workers streamed from their desks to stand vigil as the procession neared and passed the motorcade which included more than a dozen vehicles headed into the largely   neighborhood where ali spent his formative years there in the parking lot of the liquor zone nearly everyone seemed to have a story about either meeting ali or being inspired by him robert mitchem known as “froot loop” because people mistakenly think he likes that cereal set up a shirt stand with two friends early in the morning mitchem wanted to be ready for the     chance to commemorate the city’s most famous son and make a few bucks at it “fruit” or “fruity” as mitchem is also known had an array of different colored   with ali’s picture and his most famous catchphrases like “float like a butterfly sting like a bee ” “i hope to sell all of them and when i die i hope someone is going to have my name on a shirt too” he said with a chuckle at  the shirts which mitchem makes with a silk screen and heat press in the basement of his home were a relative bargain and word in the neighborhood was out first a handful and then a torrent of customers came to buy the shirts then they opened lawn chairs bottles of water and other stronger beverages and awaited the   heavyweight champion “he was a dignitary from the sports world who traveled the globe but he never forgot where he came from” said wayne simon  who remembers ali visiting their alma mater central high school after he won a gold medal at the  olympic games in rome despite the searing sun and rising temperatures the several hundred people assembled in and around the parking lot celebrated ali anew donald “doc” burress  remembers as a kid crowding around his family’s    television to watch ali knock out sonny liston “what he did for louisville he was our spokesman” burress said his daughter and two grandchildren sitting by his side “he was bigger than churchill downs” the famed horse racing track that hosts the kentucky derby thalisa price who wore a leather vest with her nickname “ms lovely” stitched on the back wanted to buy an ali shirt before leaving for memphis on saturday with her motorcycle club the naptown riders “i’m going to wear this shirt to let people know we’re from louisville” she said eventually the police closed traffic on broadway and helicopters circled above the big intersection the crowds on every corner swelled further one fan who held a pair a red boxing gloves yelled “come on champ take your time we ain’t gonna see you no more ” a few minutes later the motorcade arrived and as in downtown ali’s fans rushed into the street the procession passed heading toward the boxer’s childhood home on grand avenue people started folding their lawn chairs and heading back to their own homes mitchem though still had work to do having sold more than  dozen shirts he was going to rush home and print some more “that was awesome” he said “it sent chills through me because it was like pure love ”',\n",

so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late great deconstructionist master jean baudrillard during the postmod s it was hip to be baudrillardian to the core his america originally published in france in  should still be read today as the definitive metaphysicalgeologicalcultural instagram of exceptionalistan by the late s at the end of the millennium two years before  – that seminal «before and after» event  baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze now it’s a black market paroxysm global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work – as in the deregulation of the official market a black market of unemployment a black market of financial speculation a black market of misery and poverty a black market of sex as in prostitution a black market of information as in espionage and shadow wars a black market of weapons and even a black market of thinking way beyond the late  th century in the s what the west praises as «liberal democracy» – actually a neoliberal diktat  has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l’oeil effect what’s left is a widespread noxious condition the preemptive prohibition of any critical thought which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine or finding the right internet niche baudrillard already knew that the concept of «alter»  killed by conviviality  does not exist in the official market so an «alter» black market also sprung up coopted by traffickers that’s for instance the realm of racism nativism and other forms of exclusion baudrillard already identified how a «contraband alter» expressed by sects and every form of nationalism nowadays think about the spectrum between jihadism and extremeright wing political parties was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant obsessed with regimentation and totally homogenized there could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures signs differences and «values» but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact it replica – artificial intelligence playing with the line of demarcation between human and nonhuman in the domain of thought the result previewed by baudrillard was the secretion of a parapolitical society  with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption think the financial masters of the universe power is unable to fight this mafia  and that would be on top of it hypocritical because the mafia itself emanates from power the end result is that what really matters today anywhere mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits like in a social black market is there any information «truth» baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine producing value producing signs of wealth but not wealth itself the whole media  information system – still ruled by america  is a massive machine producing events as signs exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology the star system and catastrophism this abstraction of information works as in the economy – disgorging a coded material deciphered in advance and negotiable in terms of models as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value since all merchandise thanks to this abstraction of value is exchangeable then every event or nonevent is also exchangeable all replacing one another in the cultural market of information and that takes us to where we live now transhistory and transpolitics – where events have really not happened as they get lost in the vacuum of information as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation thus this quintessential baudrillard insight if we consider history as a movie – and that’s what it is now – then the «truth» of information is no more than postproduction synch dubbing and subtitles still as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events there is immense disappointment as well because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them call it a pathetic universal contagion people don’t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm – in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences no acts deeds crimes the  financial crisis political events the wikileaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the «nonprofit» clinton cash machine what’s private and what’s public the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth and the affairs of the state seem to have real consequences immunity impunity corruption speculation  we veer towards a state of zero responsibility think goldman sachs so automatically we yearn for an event of maximum consequence a «fatal» event to repair that scandalous nonequivalence like a symbolic reequilibrium of the scales of destiny so we dream of an amazing event – trump winning the election hillary declaring wwiii  that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes shadowing the world just like baudrillard i got to see «deep» america in the s and s by driving across america so sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning «objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear» but what if they may also be further than they appear the contemporary instant eventcelebrity culture deluge of images upon us does it get us closer to a socalled «real» world that is in fact very far away from us or does it in fact keep the world at a distance – creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent in parallel we keep slouching towards a single future language – the language of algorithms as designed across the wall street  silicon valley axis – that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe just like the globalistnew world order dream of one thought and one culture languages are multiple and singular – by definition if there were a single language words would become univocal regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning there would be no interplay – as in artificial languages there’s no interplay

the company in which workers are sometimes pitted against one another and where a blind eye is turned to infractions from top performers interviews with more than  current and former uber employees as well as reviews of internal emails chat logs and   meetings paint a picture of an often unrestrained workplace culture among the most egregious accusations from employees who either witnessed or were subject to incidents and who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation one uber manager groped female  ’ breasts at a company retreat in las vegas a director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employee’s head in with a baseball bat until this week this culture was only whispered about in silicon valley then on sunday susan fowler an engineer who left uber in december published a blog post about her time at the company she detailed a history of discrimination and sexual harassment by her managers which she said was shrugged off by uber’s human resources department ms fowler said the culture was stoked  —   and even fostered  —   by those at the top of the company “it seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor’s job” ms fowler wrote “no attempts were made by these managers to hide what they were doing they boasted about it in meetings told their direct reports about it and the like ” her revelations have spurred   over how unfriendly silicon valley workplaces can be to women and provoked an internal crisis at uber the company’s chief executive travis kalanick has opened an internal investigation into the accusations and has brought in the board member arianna huffington and the former attorney general eric h holder jr to look into harassment issues and the human resources department to contain the fallout mr kalanick also began more disclosure on monday he said that   percent of uber’s engineering product management and scientist roles were filled by women and that those numbers had not changed substantively over the past year mr kalanick also held a     meeting on tuesday during which he and other executives were besieged with dozens of questions and pleas from employees who were aghast at  —   or strongly identified with  —   ms fowler’s story and demanded change in what was described by five attendees as an emotional moment and according to a video of the meeting reviewed by the new york times mr kalanick apologized to employees for leading the company and the culture to this point “what i can promise you is that i will get better every day” he said “i can tell you that i am authentically and fully dedicated to getting to the bottom of this ” some uber employees said mr kalanick’s speedy efforts were positive “i am pleased with how quickly travis has responded to this” aimee lucido an uber software engineer wrote  in a blog post “we are better situated to handle this sort of problem than we have ever been in the past ” as chief executive mr kalanick has long set the tone for uber under him uber has taken a pugnacious approach to business flouting local laws and criticizing competitors in a race to expand as quickly as possible mr kalanick  has made pointed displays of ego in a gq article in  he referred to uber as “ ” because of how the company helped him attract women that tone has been echoed in uber’s workplace at least two former uber workers said they had notified thuan pham the company’s chief technical officer of workplace harassment at the hands of managers and colleagues in  one also emailed mr kalanick uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse at the hands of managers according to legal documents reviewed by the times other current and former employees said they were considering legal action against the company liane hornsey uber’s chief human resources officer said in a statement “we are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone ” uber’s aggressive culture began with its  founding when mr kalanick and another founder garrett camp created a   that would let customers hail a cab with little more than a few taps of their smartphone  —   bypassing many of the headaches people had with the taxi industry mr kalanick also started putting into place what eventually became uber’s  core values inspired by the leadership principles at one of the biggest public tech companies amazon to grow quickly uber kept its structure decentralized emphasizing autonomy among regional offices general managers are encouraged to “be themselves” another of uber’s core values and are empowered to make decisions without intense supervision from the company’s san francisco headquarters the top priority achieve growth and revenue targets while uber is now the dominant   company in the united states and is rapidly growing in south america india and other countries its explosive growth has come at a cost internally as uber hired more employees its internal politics became more convoluted getting ahead employees said often involved undermining departmental leaders or colleagues workers like ms fowler who went to human resources with their problems said they were often left stranded she and a   others said human resources often made excuses for top performers because of their ability to improve the health of the business occasionally problematic managers who were the subject of numerous complaints were shuffled around different regions firings were less common one group appeared immune to internal scrutiny the current and former employees said members of the group called the   and composed of executives who were personally close to mr kalanick were shielded from much accountability over their actions one member of the   was emil michael senior vice president for business who was caught up in a public scandal over comments he made in  about digging into the private lives of journalists who opposed the company mr kalanick defended mr michael saying he believed mr michael could learn from his mistakes uber’s aggressive workplace culture spilled out at a global   meeting in late  in las vegas where the company hired beyoncé to perform at the rooftop bar of the palms hotel between bouts of drinking and gambling uber employees used cocaine in the bathrooms at private parties said three attendees and a manager groped several female employees the manager was terminated within  hours one employee hijacked a private shuttle bus filled it with friends and took it for a joy ride the attendees said at the las vegas outing mr kalanick also held a companywide lecture reviewing uber’s  core values the attendees said during the lecture mr kalanick pulled onstage employees who he believed exemplified each of the values one of those was mr michael since ms fowler’s blog post several uber employees have said they are considering leaving the company some are waiting until their equity compensation from uber which is restricted stock units is vested others said they had started sending résumés to competitors still other employees said they were hopeful that uber could change mr kalanick has promised to deliver a diversity report to better detail the number of women and minorities who work at uber and the company is holding listening sessions with employees at the tuesday   meeting ms huffington the uber board member also vowed that the company would make another change according to attendees and video of the meeting ms huffington said there

       " 'fed turns to trump agenda with rate hike nearly in the bag washington reuters  the federal reserve inaugurates the trump era this week with a nearcertain interest rate increase and new economic forecasts providing a first glimpse into whether the us election has reshaped the central bank’s growth and inflation outlook fed fund futures show a  percent probability that the fed will lift rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its twoday policy meeting on wednesday according to the cme group all  economists in a reuters poll expect a rate hike in the wake of a string of solid us economic reports more telling will be whether the stock market rally and jump in bond yields triggered by trump’s nov  victory will push the fed to an inflection point of its own and a higher projected pace of rate increases for  and beyond the republican businessman is inheriting a good economy one that grew by  percent in the third quarter the fastest pace in two years there are however concerns that his plan to reduce taxes cut regulation and increase infrastructure spending could not just boost the economy but also fuel higher inflation since first published in  the fed’s quarterly “dot plot” of projected interest rates has generally moved in one direction – down – and any postelection change will show whether policymakers expect trump’s policies to shake things up as of september fed officials’ median projection was for two rate increases next year and a long run “neutral” level of  percent a rate increase this week would be the first since last december and only the second since the  financial crisis    “their path is going to move up faster and a little sooner” said steve rick chief economist for cuna mutual group he said the economy was running at its potential and that was the fed’s cue to “exit stage right” and steadily move rates to normal fed officials have long hoped that other government policies would take the place of monetary engineering which some believe may have lost its effectiveness in lifting economic growth  they have warned in recent weeks that any new government spending should specifically be designed to boost productivity in an economy that is already near full employment and facing a high public debt burden the fed’s new forecasts will indicate if policymakers feel that the monetarytofiscal handover is on the horizon or need more time for the trump administration’s plans to become more detailed and move through congress fed chair janet yellen is scheduled to hold a press conference at  pm  gmt on wednesday to elaborate on the economic outlook and policy statement she’ll have a broad set of issues to cover since her last press conference in september  from the federal open market committee meeting itself to the likelihood she will be replaced in early  and the risks she foresees from the trump agenda trump repeatedly attacked yellen during the election campaign accusing her of holding down rates to help his democratic rival since the election he has expressed his disapproval of corporate america criticizing boeing ban and took credit for a deal to keep hundreds of jobs at an indiana plant from being moved to mexico  the presidentelect also will be under scrutiny after this week’s fed meeting for clues about how he plans to handle his relationship with the central bank “there is a real risk that he could be openly critical of the decision to raise rates next week” paul ashworth an economist with capital economics said in a note last week  that could upset markets and raise serious issues about whether trump intends to leave the fed alone or try to influence its decisions top us elected officials in particular the president typically avoid criticizing the fed’s shortterm rate decisions emphasizing instead the need for monetary policy to be set independently “if he remains silent after the announcement to raise interest rates next wednesday then we can begin to assume that it will be business as usual for the fed” ashworth wrote trump’s plan to cut taxes and regulation and funnel fresh billions into capital projects must pass congress and it may be well after that before any new programs meaningfully effect economic forecasts but policymakers also watch the markets closely it may be hard for the fed to stick with its ultraslow pace of rate hikes if a major tax overhaul and fiscal spending plan are unleashed  td securities analysts said that fiscal policy at this point in the economic recovery could prompt “an inflationary demand shock” that adds nearly a percentage point to economic growth but spurs the fed to raise rates much quicker than expected  by nearly an extra percentage point per year  that scenario of a central bank caught behind the curve and forced to act faster is one that yellen and other policymakers have said they hope to avoid out of fear it could prompt a recession  fed officials in recent days have acknowledged the trump agenda may cause them to switch gears though it is not clear how soon “at this juncture it is premature to reach firm conclusions” new york fed president william dudley said last week  but since trump won the election dudley added “the stock market has firmed bond yields have risen and the dollar has appreciated  market participants now anticipate that fiscal policy will turn more expansionary and that the fomc will likely respond by tightening monetary policy a bit more quickly than previously anticipated” for a graphic on the trump inflection click here ',\n",

       " 'iran aircraft deals hang by thread as trump targets tehran paris reuters  president donald trump s hawkish new approach towards tehran coupled with banking worries and domestic political turbulence in both countries are causing growing uncertainty over iran s  billion deal to buy airliners from boeing airbus and atr iranair s decision to buy a total of  aircraft from the two giants and francoitalian turboprop maker atr marked the zenith of a  pact between tehran and world powers to renew trade in exchange for placing curbs on iran s nuclear activity iranair says its  billion deal with boeing is the biggest with a us company since the  islamic revolution  such high stakes make the deals a prominent target for critics of detente in both washington and tehran and experts say that could further frighten off european banks and others whose reluctance to provide finance is already a major obstacle trump struck a blow against the nuclear agreement with iran on friday choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it his iran strategy angered tehran and put washington at odds with other signatories of the accord  britain france germany russia china and the european union  some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with iran while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement he gave the us congress  days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact even without such sanctions the fate of the aircraft deals depends on us administration approval several people involved in the airliner deals fear they have become too big to cancel but too sensitive to implement fully beyond a limited number of jets for which iran has the funds to pay for in cash without foreign loans  i don t see who would be willing to provide financing for iran with such a negative groundswell in the united states  said consultant and former aviation banker bertrand grabowski that raises immediate concerns for boeing as it prepares to start building  longrange twinengined er jets originally due for delivery to iran from next april  the fate of those aircraft  part of a total order for  jets  is seen affecting jobs as boeing tries to put a floor under declining production of one of its most profitable models  for the s it seems increasingly difficult now  a western banker said unexpected hurdles have arisen on the iranian side too financial sources say boeing has already had to push iran back in the queue for jets because it has yet to receive a deposit for now boeing can manage by juggling deliveries with other airlines but a complete breakdown of the iranair order could put new pressure on  production us exports are not the only ones at stake although the european union backs the nuclear deal the export of any western aircraft to iran depends on permits from the us administration because of the number of us parts that means airbus could get caught in the crossfire between boeing and congressional critics who want the whole deal axed something likely to deepen tensions over iran with europe iran has so far imported nine aircraft three from airbus and six from turboprop maker atr     losing the rest of iran s business would hit airbus s order book hard because it took the risk of booking all  iranian plane sales last december to help beat boeing in their annual order race boeing has not yet formally posted its orders     because the airbus and boeing deals are so interconnected with approvals passing through washington all eyes are now on how trump s administration will treat the highprofile plane deals while kicking the broader nuclear issue to congress iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said on saturday any negative move would be considered a violation of the  nuclear pact between tehran and world powers  industry sources say washington has so far issued licenses for aircraft sales to iran until the end of the decade after which they must be renewed  based on estimated delivery plans that effectively opens the door to the  boeing s and  airbus jets they said

       " 'when communitysupported agriculture is not what it seems  the new york times last tuesday a    subscription service called local roots nyc dropped off boxes at pickup spots in new york city including a cafe a brew pub and the offices of buzzfeed alongside locally grown rainbow chard romaine lettuce and beets some members got bottles of olive oil from italy or bars of chocolate and bags of dried pasta both   from rustic roots an   delivery service in the tristate area members could receive fruit boxes stacked with oranges pineapples and avocados although both companies use the term “c s a ”   agriculture to describe their service the presence of a middleman between the farmer and the customer is precisely what traditional c s as are designed to avoid and since olives and oranges do not grow in this region those products provide no direct income to local farmers precisely the people the c s a was invented to benefit   agriculture was originally defined by a very particular relationship between a farm and its customers starting in the s earlier in europe and japan members banded together to support a nearby farm with an upfront financial commitment to buy its produce it was a private transaction in which all the money went directly to the farmer it did not rely on distributors or    stores and it gave farmers a crucial infusion of cash for the winter used to buy seeds repair equipment and expand into new growing methods the goal was for c s a farmers and members to build a mutually supportive   relationship members would get     produce from a farmer they knew and trusted and farmers would get financial stability “there’s no other customer that pays you  percent in advance year after year” said maggie wood an owner of golden earthworm farm on the north fork of long island ms wood’s farm is entirely supported by its   c s a members as demand for local and organic produce has ballooned in the last five years so have other ideas for connecting farmers to customers now online hubs are using sophisticated distribution technology to snap into the food chain often using “c s a ” to describe what they deliver the term is not regulated in most states so companies can define it as they wish peapod the online shopping service owned by the international grocery giant ahold delivers   boxes throughout the northeast freshdirect offers a variety of c s a options in and around new york city as the “farm share” concept has spread the c s a has become just another part of the sprawling messy modern system of knowing where your food comes from and choosing what you want to eat the opportunity for confusion is of enormous concern to many farmers in the new york region depending on how and where these new businesses buy their produce consumers can receive all the benefits of c s a membership while the farmers get only a fraction some farmers say that after years of steady growth their c s a memberships have dropped since the arrival of services like local roots or farmigo “at first it seemed like these services were going to be great for us” said eve   an owner of garden of eve farm on the north fork of long island some of them supplied software management programs and marketing tools others offered premium prices close to farmers’ market rates others picked up the produce instead of requiring farmers to deliver to a central warehouse but the drawbacks can outweigh the benefits some say that these hubs have siphoned off their members partly by offering a more convenient product but also by blurring the definition of terms like “c s a ” and “farm share” so that customers believe they are directly supporting local farms with their purchases when they might not “they are absolutely in competition with us” said ben shute an owner of hearty roots farm in the hudson valley “there are only a certain number of people who will buy food this way ” ms   said that her membership had dropped from a high of  around  to  today golden earthworm katchkie farm in kinderhook n y and many other local farmers agree that after years of steady growth they have been struggling to retain old members and attract new ones and that to compete with the delivery services they are scrambling to find sources for bread cheese fruit meat eggs and other   that customers want “do consumers even know that when they sign up for one of these fake c s a s sometimes it doesn’t benefit local farmers any more than if they shop at the supermarket” ms   asked probably not the organic farm boxes you buy online may or may not be local local farm boxes may or may not be organic the farmers may or may not be paid more than wholesale prices and customers may or may not care “i just assume that if it’s organic it’s good” said raquel hoffman a c s a member in fort greene brooklyn “i can’t also worry about whether it’s local or whether the chickens were happy and all that ” taking the time to tease out whether buying granola made in brooklyn qualifies as supporting local agriculture can test the patience of consumers services like local roots offer an alluring simplicity “if the goal is to make local food accessible we need to make shopping for it as much like a   shop as possible” said   ying who founded local roots nyc “people who care about local produce are also going to care about great olive oil so i’m going to connect them to great olive oil and that money comes back to support the local food movement including farmers ” ms ying said that the more food options her customers have the more likely they are to remain in the c s a which in turn sustains the  local farms from which local roots buys traditional c s as have a high turnover rate many people simply find the system too inflexible for their needs “if we want the local food system to grow we all have to grow and evolve with it” she said “if you’re stubborn against the change it’s only going to hurt the local food movement ” eric stone who oversees c s as at freshdirect said he believed that widening distribution and raising visibility for local produce  —   as the company’s boxes do  —   benefit local agriculture in the long term hepworth farms in the hudson valley packs c s a boxes for freshdirect customers that are stamped with the farm’s own name and logo “i really think it gives them a chance to get their stuff out there” he said “it expands the whole market ” hepworth is an example of an organic farm that benefits from increased options for farmers participating in a new distribution system alongside its farmers’ market restaurant and wholesale businesses now that local food has become big business target and walmart are trying to get a piece of it and even amazon is delivering locally grown kale this new demand has been a boon for many farmers across the country especially   farmers equipped to sell in bulk new sales channels have been opened that they could never have accessed independently small farmers say they have no problem with new markets for local food they just don’t want them to be called c s a s paula lukats is the program director of just food an advocacy and education group for local agriculture in new york state she confirmed that after a peak in  memberships in   agriculture groups have been going down “across the board ” for the sake of clarity she said she wishes that middlemen would stop using the term “c s a ” altogether “the c s a system was developed for consumers and for small farmers” ms lukats said “the   was low prices and guaranteed income anything you put in the middle of that raises the prices for the consumer or takes away money from the farmer ” but in interviews with farmers policy makers and entrepreneurs all parties agreed that for fragile local food systems to strengthen consumers will have to be offered more choice and control over what they eat than is possible with a traditional c s a “c s as are not for everyone we know that” said maryellen driscoll of free bird farm in the hudson valley she estimated that her farm’s income will be down   compared to last year from the loss of c s a members “what’s frustrating is that the copycats have such a lack of transparency and it’s very easy for the real issues to be glossed over ” the real issues facing c s a farms and the food system are not confined to the new york metropolitan area judith redmond an owner of full belly farm in yolo calif said that membership in its c s a one of the oldest and biggest in california has dropped this season after holding steady at   with a perpetual waiting list since  ms redmond belongs to the community alliance with family farmers a group that was instrumental in having the phrase “  agriculture” codified by the california legislature effective in  it is the only state that has done so ben shute of hearty roots said that there are financial risks for farmers in working through middlemen and they are precisely the risks that c s as were designed to eliminate “some of them want to have real relationships with farmers but some are shopping around for the best price” he said “when a farmer is growing a certain crop for them and then they go elsewhere what is that farmer supposed to do the product is perishable its value has a short life span ” some of them have proved to have a short life span in  good eggs suddenly ended deliveries in brooklyn los angeles and new orleans after just one year farmstr started with much fanfare in seattle in  also closed up shop in  and in just the last two weeks   households in new york new jersey seattle and northern california that subscribed to c s as through a company called farmigo received boxes that would be their last as the company abruptly shut down its food distribution operation  —   in the middle of the harvest season  —   to return to its core business software farmigo which started deliveries in  fueled its rapid expansion with more than  million of venture capital raised on the strength of a food distribution software platform that the founder benzi ronen claimed would eventually replace supermarkets altogether mr ronen said that was still inevitable “i never saw a conflict with the c s a s” he said “we saw a lot of customers leaving c s as because they wanted a more traditional market so we built an online farmers’ market with  items ” but the   logistics of washing packing refrigerating distributing and delivering those items to  locations proved overwhelming so farmigo members lost out on this growing season and scores of farmigo farmers were left with fields and trailers full of unsold produce still mr ronen said he did not believe that traditional c s as are the answer “i started as a   fanatic all the way at the end of the spectrum” he said “but i’ve learned that if we want to grow the number of people who have access to this food there have to be many approaches ”',\n",

saudiled coalition’s funeral bombing in sanaa yemen according to a new analysis of us government data conducted by shadowproof \\n\\nthe october  bombing killed  and wounded over  it was widely condemned by human rights groups and exposed us support for the saudiled war in yemen to greater scrutiny \\nin response to a query from shadowproof about the funeral strike state department spokesperson frankie sturm replied “ we have regularly expressed our concerns to the saudiled coalition and urged them – as we have urged all sides including the houthis – to take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian objects and return to a cessation of hostilities ” \\ndespite the us government’s purported desire for a “cessation of hostilities” and “concerns” for civilians shadowproof’s analysis shows that large quantities of us weapons continue to flow to the saudi government impeding a sustained ceasefire and enabling civilian carnage \\n\\nin july and august the us shipped saudi  million in bombs  million in parts for bombs  guided missiles worth  million one military helicopter worth  million and  armored fighting vehicles and  armored vehicles which together are worth over  million \\n\\nfrom april to july when peace talks were active the us shipped  million in armored vehicles and  million in parts for bombs talks broke down in july and were followed by a major increase in coalition air assaults in yemen \\n\\nfollowing the attack on a funeral the us government announced it was “ reviewing ” its support for the saudi coalition however as of october   there were no changes to us military support for coalition operations \\n\\na unbrokered ceasefire implemented in april ushered in a major reduction in fighting yet us weapons shipments continued \\n\\nin fact over the course of president barack obama’s administration it has approved a staggering  billion in weapons sales to saudi arabia—including a  billion sale in november  which included over  bombs and a  billion sale of tank components ammunition and other weapons \\n\\nthe us government has also provided logistical and intelligence support that has facilitated the saudi coalition’s carnage \\n\\ngiven saudi’s dependence on the us government for military support it is difficult to overstate the degree of influence the us possesses over the saudi government for example bruce riedel a senior fellow at the brookings institution said in april “if the united states of america and the united kingdom tonight told king salman that this war has to end it would end tomorrow” \\nkristine beckerle who researches yemen for human rights watch told shadowproof “the saudiled coalition’s air campaign in yemen has been devastating for civilians hitting marketplaces factories homes and hospitals there is no question us weapons have been used in some of these unlawful attacks including one of the most deadly the us should be suspending arms sales to saudi until it not only curbs unlawful strikes but also credibly investigates those that have already occurred” \\na survey conducted by the yemen data project found that from the beginning of the saudi coalition’s air campaign in yemen in march  through august of  more than onethird of the coalition’s  strikes hit nonmilitary targets \\n“the coalition is responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together virtually all as a result of air strikes” un human rights chief zeid ra’ad alhussein said back in march \\n\\nnasser arrabyee a journalist in sanaa told shadowproof “in the first weeks of the war the battle for sanna was over all the military sites were destroyed yet the coalition strikes continue on a daily basis often hitting civilians” \\n\\nthe us government continues to insist the saudi coalition isn’t intentionally targeting civilians but colette gadenne who heads médecins sans frontières’ msf yemen mission told shadowproof “we’ve seen airstrikes hit civilian locations so often for example there was a strike on a crowded marketplace in harad at  pm on july  it took place after people broke their ramadan fast and we only know about the strikes we see directly”\\n\\nthree msf hospitals one msf mobile clinic and an msf ambulance were attacked by coalition forces \\n\\nafter the funeral attack images appeared on social media allegedly showing fragments of a ussupplied tail fin for a jdam guidance kit for a usmade mark   lb bomb \\n\\nali alahmed an expert on saudi arabia at the institute for gulf affairs and himself a saudi told shadowproof the saudis indeed target civilians \\n\\n“they couldn’t defeat the houthis on the battlefield so they’re killing women and children bombing schools to get that result” ahmed explained \\nback in  us army whistleblower chelsea manning disclosed a state department cable from the same year that showed the us government provided “imagery” of the yemen border to the saudi government despite evidence saudi aircraft were attacking civilians when attacking houthis in northern yemen assistant minister of defense and aviation prince khaled bin sultan appealed to a us ambassador to give them a predator drone to help limit civilian casualties\\n\\nanother cable from  that was also disclosed by manning shows the us government approved military assistance for saudi arabia or yemen if aid was not used against houthis since then the us government has allowed the saudi kingdom to pull them into an openended war \\nwith regard to al qaida ahmed noted “hundreds of saudi jets and their allies bombing yemeni forces have avoided bombing…positions in yemen of al qaida”\\n\\n“the saudi air force is really becoming the air force for alqaida” ahmed said “the saudi bombings have helped mostly one group alqaida” \\nahmed also stressed the bombings fuel “antiamericanism” prior to the war the yemeni government cooperated closely with the us in counterterrorism matters\\n\\nin a letter to president obama  members of congress urged him to block the  billion arms deal announced in august the letter stated “amnesty international has documented at least  unlawful airstrikes by the saudi arabialed coalition across yemen that appear to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilians facilities such as hospitals schools markets and places of worship these attacks may amount to war crimes”\\n\\naccording to a recent report by reuters the coalition has hit sites the us government put on a “do not strike” list the us designated these locations as being vital infrastructure for delivery of food aid and for postwar reconstruction\\n\\nthe saudi coalition declared as a target the entire saada governorate measuring  square miles which borders saudi arabia it also reportedly used incendiary weapons white phosphorous as well as cluster weapons which are banned by most countries \\nboth of these weapons were supplied by the us\\n\\nthe war’s effect on civilians in yemen is enormous “the jets overhead scare the children there is no place people can go to be safe even hospitals are hit in strikes the population is traumatized” gadenne said\\n\\nmore than  civilians have been killed since the saudiled coalition began including more than  children more than  percent of the population now requires some form of humanitarian assistance for survival\\n\\nbeatriz ochoa from save the children told shadowproof “the number of children that are severely malnourished has doubled to  since the beginning of the coalition bombing  million women and children under  are suffering from acute malnutrition with over  million or roughly half of yemen’s population are considered food insecure”\\n\\nthe coalition imposed a blockade which has resulted in shortages of medicine and food as well as price spikes and hoarding of goods\\n\\nrecently there was a reported cholera outbreak which may exacerbate the already dangerous health crisis\\n\\nanother serious concern is unexploded ordnance “a yearold girl was collecting firewood in sadaa and there had been an air strike in the area  months prior an unexploded ordnance went off and she lost a leg” gadenne recalled\\n\\nms gadenne said msf has seen victims from unexploded ordnance all over the country research from amnesty international found thousands of unexploded munitions in northern yemen following a day tour of the region earlier this year \\nthe dire humanitarian crisis resulting from the war has given rise to a great deal of anger in yemen according to arrabyee “yemenis see the war as an american war as the coalition couldn’t carry out the strikes in yemen without us support there is a big campaign saying americans are the ones killing the yemenis people”\\n\\nwilliam hartung from the center for international policy told shadowproof the us is directly involved in yemen even if it’s not the one dropping the bombs \\n“without us support there’s no way saudi coalition could wage the war at this level” hartung said “the large weapons deals and midflight refueling provided by the us play an important role in saudi’s ability to conduct strikes

       " 'crossing the border here’s how to safeguard your data from searches  the new york times travelers beware when you take your gadgets abroad maintaining the security of the data on your devices is just as important as protecting yourself from muggers for whatever reason foreign and domestic governments may have an interest in your personal data including your social media accounts this is not just theoretical several travelers including american citizens like haisam elsharkawi were recently pressured into giving officers from the united states customs and border protection access to their cellphones at the airport some travelers now face additional privacy risks because of a new regulation that separates them from their computing equipment this week the department of homeland security announced that passengers traveling from eight   countries to the united states could not bring devices larger than cellphones onto planes so computers tablets and other devices will have to be stowed in checked luggage legally citizens are not required to unlock their cellphones or share their passwords with united states government officials but rules may vary depending on where you are traveling to and from and any stopping by a government official can be inconvenient and even intimidating what to do there’s one thing all the experts agree on do not lie to government officials about your passwords or social media accounts “they’d make your life miserable if they found that out” said jeremiah grossman the head of security strategy for sentinelone a computer security company but there are methods for safeguarding your cellphones tablets and computers from invasive searches all while remaining honest here are some of the best tips based on interviews with security and forensics specialists the best way to prevent your information from being searched is to travel with a device that never had any of your data in the first place it’s a wise idea to invest in a   travel device a cheap smartphone or computer that you use only abroad you don’t want your nice equipment to get lost or stolen while traveling anyway let alone searched by border agents so leave your fancy equipment  —   along with your photo album facebook snapchat and twitter apps  —   at home which devices to buy the wirecutter the product recommendations site owned by the new york times published a guide on budget android phones including the  moto g play that comes unlocked so that it can work with foreign sim cards for cheap computers consider a  acer laptop or a  dell chromebook fingerprint sensors like the ones found on many apple and android smartphones are a nifty security feature for unlocking your phone quickly but jonathan zdziarski a security researcher who has taught forensics courses to law enforcement agencies on collecting data from smartphones said your best bet when traveling was to turn the feature off that’s because in the united states law enforcement agencies have successfully used warrants to compel people to unlock their cellphones with a fingerprint but because of your right to remain silent it would be tough though not impossible for the federal government to force you to share your passcode so disabling your fingerprint sensor when traveling is generally a safer move the best way to protect your passwords is to not know them when resisting a data frisk it is easier to say you didn’t memorize your password as opposed to refusing to provide it to border agents mr grossman said “if you don’t know them it’s hard to compel you to give them over if you don’t know how” he said “even if somebody put a gun to my head i don’t know it ” password management apps like password and lastpass can automatically create strong lengthy passwords for all your online accounts and keep them stored in a vault that is accessible with one master password however mr grossman said you are better off traveling without your password management software loaded on your devices so that you won’t be asked to hand over the master password to your vault you could store a copy of the password vault on a cloud service like dropbox and get access to your vault of passwords when you reach your travel destination he said an alternative to using a   app is to write your passwords down and leave them with someone you trust after getting through customs contact that person and ask him or her to read off your passwords in the unlikely event that you are asked to provide a password to your email or social media account having   verification enabled will act as an extra safeguard  —   assuming that you left your primary cellphone at home with   verification turned on whenever you enter your password you will receive a text message with a   code that you must enter before you can log in because the message containing the code would be sent to your phone at home a customs agent wouldn’t be able to log in to your account even if you gave up your password of course   verification could make logging in to your accounts difficult for yourself if you left your primary cellphone at home you could always leave your phone with someone you trust and contact them to ask for codes when you are trying to log in however it would generally be wiser to stay off your social media accounts while traveling to avoid leaving any traces of data on a burner device whether you are using a burner device or your own always make sure to lock down the system with encryption which scrambles your data so it becomes indecipherable without the right key desktop apps like bitlocker or apple’s filevault let you encrypt your hard drive requiring a passphrase to decrypt your files to avoid surrendering this passphrase you could jot it down and hand it to a friend and contact that person for the passphrase after crossing the border when you’re traveling at minimum you will need access to your address book and calendar and you may also want to take some photos but this is all sensitive information that border patrol agents could get their hands on your best option is to back up your data to a cloud service and then wipe or erase all the data from your device before arriving at the border mr zdziarski said after passing through customs you could then restore your information from the online backup',\n",
       " 'meet covergirl’s new cover boy  the new york times beauty contracts have long been a brass ring for celebrities acknowledgment of their rising profiles that also provides additional income and the chance to tap wider audiences so what does it mean that covergirl’s latest face joining the ranks of zendaya katy perry pink and more is   …     a boy and a noncelebrity boy at that he is james charles  a high school senior from bethlehem n y who lives with his parents and a younger brother and does makeup for friends in his spare time at no charge in the past year or so mr charles has amassed nearly   followers on his instagram account and more than   subscribers on his youtube channel where he posts tutorials for creating fake freckles or layering chunky glitter around the eyes he gained attention last month when he posted to social media about retaking his senior photos because he didn’t like how the highlighter on his cheekbones looked in the originals for the second set mr charles brought his own ring light his post spread on twitter garnering a comment and repost from the singer zendaya who wrote “you win ” the selection of mr james by covergirl comes amid a broader questioning of traditional gender boundaries in fashion and beauty and the growth of a crop of   beauty junkies who have built followings through social media on the more traditional celebrity end there’s jaden smith and his unceasing effort to make skirts mainstream for men the musician and actor son of will smith and jada pinkett smith appeared in louis vuitton’s women’s wear campaign last january donned a shift dress for prom and is generally a fan of “super drapey things” he told gq there’s also the rapper young thug who made waves in august when he released the cover art for his album “no my name is jeffery” featuring him in a tiered froufrou dress that recalled both japanese kimonos and the antebellum south before then he’d worn dresses for a calvin klein campaign “there’s no such thing as gender” he said in the ad and for dazed magazine within fashion designers such as alessandro michele of gucci j w anderson demna gvasalia of balenciaga and shayne oliver of hood by air have all become known for testing notions about gender dressing and in beauty a group of young men have made their way into the industry through a   entrepreneurial effort entrenched in youtube instagram twitter and snapchat with devoted followings they have carved out a space to experiment and expand the notion of being male from these intersecting forces comes mr charles despite his newfound fame he is spending a lot of his time figuring out where to apply for college still he did find a few minutes to discuss his new role online bullying and why what he does is different from drag this interview has been edited and condensed what was it like when you found out about your new gig  i screamed and started to cry it’s all been so ridiculous and crazy and fast i’ve barely gotten any sleep but i’m   k with it what was it like to work with katy perry it was the coolest surprise ever she was so kind we were posing for pictures together and we were hugging each other and she said “i can feel you shaking i’m just as nervous as you are ” to hear that someone at her level was just as nervous for a shoot as me calmed my nerves and put me in a place of “oh i can actually do this ” what can you bring to covergirl as a boy  i love to do glam but i also love a lot of creative     stuff the fact that i am the first boy is so cool it shows that this industry is actually becoming genderless and we’re really making the push toward equal opportunities for everybody regardless of race sexuality gender i think it’s a huge steppingstone for such a big and iconic company hopefully other people will see this and when they think “oh this random    kid just started doing makeup recently and is now the face of covergirl” i hope that inspires them to really be themselves and feel comfortable and wear makeup and express themselves in a manner they haven’t been comfortable doing before do you think a lot of boys want to try makeup  absolutely oh my gosh i see new guys on my instagram feed every single day rocking amazing makeup looks and crazy     stuff it’s a growing industry and the population of boys in the industry is growing as well as more and more guys come to light the way the internet is there will be people who don’t agree those negative comments probably make people not want to do it because lots of people take that stuff very seriously which is totally understandable online bullying has been a huge problem forever men in makeup is becoming more widely accepted but it’s going to take so much more   to have it be a common thing how do you deal with negative online comments my followers are some of the most loyal people out there they know everything about me and my life they know all my drama with guys that i have crushes on all that stupid stuff that doesn’t really matter but all that stuff allows me to build a close relationship with them so even though i get hate comments every once in a while it doesn’t affect me because i have so many more people who are supporting me and loving me for who i am if somebody doesn’t like me behind the keyboard oh well everybody has the right to their own opinion i’ll just continue to do me have you ever responded to people who are critical not really it’s kind of a waste of my time i have to focus on me and on school and my friends and family in the past the only ones i have replied to are the ones that questioned my character i don’t care if someone makes fun of me but if someone calls me a mean person or something i reply if you don’t like me in makeup that’s o k but i would like people to like me as a person what do you think of where we are as a country on gay rights and gender identity the place we’re in is phenomenal compared to where we were a few years ago we’ve made so many amazing progressions with gay rights gender inclusivity and   but i think we still have so so much longer to go a lot of people still don’t support or understand it gay marriage laws were passed recently now with people on social media and boys in makeup we’re becoming more accepting in general we have a lot longer to go all of our biggest issues have taken a long time what compelled you to try makeup before i did makeup i did hair for one of my best friends i did her hair for a military ball at a local school and she was an hour late for her makeup appointment at a local counter and she asked me to do her makeup i’d been watching makeup tutorials for years and years but i’d never actually done it and i was like “girl i will do your makeup but if you look awful i’m not taking credit for it ” she was like “o k we’ll do it because i have no other option ” and she ended up looking absolutely stunning i wanted to continue i bought a starter set online i did my friends’ makeup for fun not charging them anything then i started charging  or  and then i’d take that money to buy new brushes or new equipment after about three months i made my instagram page and here we are one year later were you experimenting on yourself before creating your instagram i mostly did my friends’ makeup i did drag makeup on myself twice just to see what it was because i’ve always been a fan of “rupaul’s drag race” and drag in general it looked absolutely horrible i have the pictures in a locked folder on my phone they will never ever be released anywhere speaking of drag how is what you do different they are really similar in expressing yourself and releasing your creative juices but boys in makeup are boys in makeup when you’re a drag performer you’re a boy in makeup performing as a female drag is performance artistry what look are you dying to try  i have a bunch of really cool halloween tutorials planned i have a huge list i need to make sure they’re totally appropriate and everybody can enjoy them halloween is always a touchy subject but other than that i don’t really plan my looks ahead of time i’ll do my base makeup and then i’ll just start throwing some colors on there and ask “what can i create now” what’s your best makeup tip highlighting is a huge trend right now if you really want your highlights to pop  —   which is obviously what the goal is duh  —   when you’re applying your highlighter spritz your brush with water before you dip it into your highlighter it will be   and magnetic you will be blinding people left and right',\n",

canada’s general romeo dallaire in his recent memoir waiting for first light my ongoing battle with ptsd   dallaire reveals that his return also began a pattern of suicide attempts blamed on ptsd perhaps survivor’s guilt but which these years later might be traced more accurately to his reluctance to understand that the people who sent him to rwanda did not care for humanity \\ndallaire a protector continues to affirm canada’s adherence to a code of genocide prevention on paper and as a senior fellow contributes to the montreal institute for genocide and human rights studies it is the major genocide prevention ngo in canada but noted for coincidences of policy with those of the us state department and canadian foreign service any migs project concerned with the genocide of us or canadian aboriginal peoples or of palestinians is hard to find our society’s intransigence of not caring hardens \\ncurrently it’s not even helpful to discuss a relationship between the us and the convention on genocide since us foreign policies lack moral compass having withdrawn from the rome statute of the international criminal court the us avoids charges of genocide as long as it has the military power to do so with less military power canada subscribing to the court needs moral and political power to maintain its borders of necessity diplomacy has meaning canada ratified the convention on genocide in   a generation before the us which waited until  \\nseveral current news items lead to the same point of focus canada’s evasion of its responsibility to honour and adhere to the convention on genocide its unfaithfulness encourages states of emergency to play out through indigenous communities in canada it’s also evident in foreign policies against more distant peoples as though the convention on genocide were not primary law had no statute of limitations has no affect beyond the good will and salaried hopes of ngo’s and no application to first world countries \\ncanadian mining companies \\nfrom toronto the justice and accountability project has just issued a report on the responsibility of canadian mining companies for one level of violence in latin america the “canada brand” violence and canadian mining companies in latin america  documents  deaths and  injuries in the years  to  all involving canadian companies in latin america and declares this is the tip of an iceberg it classifies the majority of the victims as “targeted” \\nwhile the report includes cases of criminalization it doesn’t include reports of deaths and injuries which aren’t verified by two independent sources and it doesn’t include “death threats deliberate burning of crops and property destruction forced displacement reported assassination attempts without reported injury illness from environmental contamination or psychological trauma from any of the violence…”  or countries in other regions such as in canada or africa this is  years of violence against native protectors of the land without bringing to bear the effects of the mining companies on entire communities and their habitats to put the two together places the mining companies within a perspective of the un  convention on genocide the murder of activist protectors suggests the element of “intention” considered by us interpretation necessary to prosecution of genocide charges \\nin muskrat falls labrador on october rd  protesters entered the crown corporation nalcor’s construction site to protest the company’s reluctance to thoroughly clear vegetation and some topsoil from the land it’s about to flood uncut vegetation as well as topsoil are considered factors in the increase of methylmercury poisoning of the watershed nalcor workers are being evacuated from the camp turning their quarters over to the protesters the rcmp is blocking roads to discourage reinforcement to the protesters pam palmater a respected lawyer and mi’kmaq teaching as an associate professor in toronto sees the company’s carelessness in risking the environment to poison as part of the ongoing industrial genocide of native peoples  it’s a concern which increasingly covers settlers immigrants as both indigenous and ‘settler’groups are equally deprived of power under law mayors of four nearby towns affected by the flooding say nalcor consistently ignores them and they’ve been excluded from the talks between the company and indigenous groups \\nfirst nations \\nin northern saskatchewan so far in october four indigenous children – girls of from ten to fourteen years of age took their own lives this is part of an ongoing suicide epidemic in first nations communities of the north where the suicide rate is five times the norm for canada the government is responding by increasing the number of mental health care workers available this misses the point of the children’s final acts as a group they’re refusing life on the terms that canada offers suicide rates among northern indigenous people are a result of social engineering by canada’s dominant culture either through its lack of concern or by intention it continues the colonial genocide of subjugation what could stop the native society’s slide into hopelessness is honouring the society’s basic needs of housing water food this is not beyond the power and convenience of canadian and provincial governments it seems beyond the business game plans of resource corporations and a european mindset of superiority which permeates all areas of canadian society \\na recent article in the canadian medical association journal reveals that the children of nunavut have the highest respiratory infection rates in the world and accuses the nunavut government of covering up respiratory disease respiratory syncytial virus  rsv infections which according to statistics from  why aren’t these statistics current hospitalized  of the children in western nunavut the dosage of pharmaceuticals for treatment costs about   patient  and children often have to be flown to hospital emergency funds go to pharmaceutical companies and airlines rather than the community and improving the living conditions and poor nutrition which cause the disease rate the cycle of poverty and relief profits big business as maintained by government budgeting \\nall of these areas converge in a consideration of genocide but to mention the word “genocide” is a snare while university courses and human rights ngos raise the issue of genocide again and again as a thorn in the side of canada’s selfimage – the nuts and bolts of legally applying the convention under canadian law are so carefully controlled that the term has no meaning except in the service of a european exploitative class \\napplication of the un’s convention on genocide which has teeth within canadian law  requires permission of canada’s minister of justice  canada’s minister of justice is a political appointment by the nation’s prime minister therefore practically it isn’t likely the prime minister would ever be charged with genocide nor will his political allies nor the visiting leaders of allied countries which gives all of them a certain amount of freedom from worry and under the code of one dominant ruling elite protection is assured subsequent government administrations and ministers of justice as long as a group remains to subjugate the same provision of requiring ministerial approval applies to the prosecution of any crimes against humanity  \\nwriting about this for some years i’ve seen no challenge to this facet of canadian law which obviously protects the establishment’s governance from prosecution for one of the worst crimes known to humankind my belief is that canada could survive honest and direct application of the convention on genocide to its policies but won’t be able to if it delays in correcting root causes of disproportionate aboriginal death and disease \\nthis loophole protecting politicians who further genocide lends impunity to the policies of nato countries in their assaults on the peoples of afghanistan libya the former yugoslavia iraq syria where militarily applied policies have involved what i think wasis genocide the us british french policies find the democratically elected country heads guilty of crimes then bomb the peoples into subservience and fealty to nato it is clearly genocide against a national group again and again \\nthe media of our nato countries have formed a reality for our peoples which doesn’t recognize the criminality of nato country foreign policies in north america the governments’ impunity in oppressing first peoples blacks and all the poor while claiming to save them provides a third rail carrying the power to knock out any resistance to the terrible crimes of foreign policy necessary to corporate resource extraction with high profits \\nthe impunity is acceded to by a professional class where the judicial system is so expensive the lawyers so strictly controlled the laws so favourable to capital that there is no effective protest of obvious injustices where the mental health industry accepts as norm the murder of foreign civilian populations where the economic machinery empowered by security and surveillance would refuse existence to those who question protest and struggle effectively where the security industry believes in the fears created to further its expansion where education becomes naked training of skill sets for serving oppressive corporations where artists and writers are rewarded for saying nothing \\nthe situation of all young people gradually becomes near that of a saskatchewan indigenous girl first peoples precede us if government maintains its refusal to protect indigenous peoples with the primary human rights laws then peoples of settler stock will when convenient to power find themselves without as well we have to affirm and apply the protections of the genocide convention for others or we

httphumansarefreecombillionaireglobalistsorosexposedashtml billionaire globalist financier george soros’ moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump — exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation — and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle and several other cities saw protests according to usa today in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it’s an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous soros’ affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election resultshundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobiatonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesday’s presidential electionthe gatherings – organized by moveonorg and allies – will affirm a continued rejection of donald trump’s bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possiblewithin two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon now come reports from various protest locations that reveal a substantially coordinated effort and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned americans as the mainstream media is reporting photos from austin texas reveal a line of busses the “protestors” arrived in making their appearance seem substantially less than organic – with a direct implication of being strategically orchestrated antitrump protestors in austin today are not as organic as they seem here are the busses they came in fakeprotests trump austin pictwittercomvxhptoui — erictucker erictucker november   with evidence mounting the question must be asked is george

mb  huma pictwittercomkgxviqrb — megatron megatronssmirk november   note that the group is actively organizing protests to a democratic election that no one is contesting the legitimacy of in terms of whether the vote was rigged etc essentially they are displeased with the results and are calling for people to rise up and not accept the results for an organization that feigns to promote democracy their actions speak otherwise “this is a disaster we fought our hearts out to avert this reality but now it’s here” moveonorg staff wrote to members on wednesday “the new presidentelect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted demeaned and threatened millions of us—and millions of our friends family and loved ones both chambers of congress remain in republican hands “we are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge a time of danger for our communities and our country in this moment we have to take care of ourselves our families and our friends—especially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate including latinos women immigrants refugees black people muslims lgbt americans and so many others and we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together” perhaps the most absurd part of the protests is that presidentelect trump hasn’t made a single policy decision yet — and in fact the entire section of his website regarding banning muslims was scrubbed shortly after his election this denotes that anything said during the campaign was most likely simple election campaign rhetoric and subsequent framing of said rhetoric by the opposition the left wing organization is one of a number of progressive organizations affiliated with soros’ open society foundation sorosaffiliated organizations across the world are deeply connected to various color revolutions the arab spring and a number of other political uprisings across the globe according to a report in new eastern outlook  the totality of what is revealed in the three hacked documents show that soros is effectively the puppetmaster pulling most of the strings in kiev soros foundation’s ukraine branch international renaissance foundation irf has been involved in ukraine since  his irf doled out more than  million to ukrainian ngos two years before the fall of the soviet union creating the preconditions for ukraine’s independence from russia in  soros also admitted to financing the  maidan square protests that brought the current government into powersoros’ foundations were also deeply involved in the  orange revolution that brought the corrupt but pronato viktor yushchenko into power with his american wife who had been in the us state department in  just weeks after soros’ international renaissance foundation had succeeded in getting viktor yushchenko as president of ukraine michael mcfaul wrote an oped for the washington post mcfaul a specialist in organizing color revolutions who later became us ambassador to russia revealeddid americans meddle in the internal affairs of ukraine yes the american agents of influence would prefer different language to describe their activities — democratic assistance democracy promotion civil society support etc — but their work however labeled seeks to influence political change in ukraine anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late ’s will know that his supposedly philanthropic “democracybuilding” projects in poland russia or ukraine in the ’s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries’ wealth according to the new eastern outlook during the  presidential cycle soros committed  million dollars to the  campaign of hillary clinton per the standard clinton operating procedure this was indicative of the symbiotic relationship of favors between the billionaire and his array of political puppets across the globe as a testament to the power wielded by soros contained within wikileaks’ recent release of hacked dnc emails is a message from billionaire globalist financier george soros to hillary clinton while she was us secretary of state that clearly reveals clinton as a soros puppet found within the wikileaks’ hillary clinton email archive is an email with the subject ‘ unrest in albania ’ in which soros makes clear to clinton that “ two things need to be done urgently ” the clintonpodesta email scandal is all about satanism and pedophilia sacrificing a chicken to moloch he then directs the secretary of state to “ bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha ” and “ appoint a senior european official as mediator ” revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros — miroslav lajcak make no mistake that the events you’re seeing transpire nationwide are being orchestrated in part by a billionaire political elite class that is looking to subvert the will of the american people by attempting to foment a new american

become a marginal medium surpassed first by tv and then surviving that it would be buried by the internet yet radio is still with us more than surviving radio has introduced new ways of speaking conversing and telling stories a whole new sound has been created for example by atlantic public media  wwwatlanticorg  meanwhile some traditions continue \\nexcept that my very favorite radio show for almost three decades fits no tradition—it’s part comedy part advice column part phone callins listener callins gave radio a tremendous boost in the s \\ni continue to be a radio addict as a critic of government policies an aficionado of literary readings and a producer of “radiotahrir”  wwwradiotahrirorg  for  years on the avantgarde and activist pacifica network  wwwpacificaorg  you’d expect my favorite to be a show related to political or literary enterprise actually the program i listen to most faithfully is one that’s impossibly dissimilar it’s cartalk  this though i’m not even a car enthusiast \\ncartalk is a hilarious practical advice callin show it originated in boston  plus years ago by two feisty italian brothers tom and ray magliozzi both garage mechanics the doityourselfsort but to figure out their degree qualifications see wwwcartalkcomcontenttomandraysbiosphotos a perfectly paired team with a shared irrepressible sense of humor \\nthink about it how often while listening to a noncomedy radio broadcast do you find yourself chuckling not only this these hosts engage in banter and howls of laughter while dispensing serious counsel –all having to do with cars threaded though the humor is lots of useful and reliable car advice they really have to be good because of safety liability the reputations both of cars they discuss and garage mechanics their guests already consulted the stimulus for tom’s and ray’s comments are calls from listeners challenging the brothers with simple complex and silly car problems mechanical problems disputes with their local mechanic family predicaments around coownership repair costs holiday motoring anxieties and inheritance problems cars often pass from parents to children the issues are actual problems which cars especially older models experience and americans keep their cars for a long time \\ncartalk  in my view is the most engaging program on us radio on radio anywhere a weekly one hour show it’s been airing every saturday morning as long as i can remember with the passing of tom the older member of the team in  the live broadcast ended today the program continues as the best of car talk  edited from their archives meanwhile wwwcartalkcom carries a full show highlighted moments of fun or guidance automotive news and abundant free car advice \\npart of the success of the program in addition to the spirited character and compatibility of the brothers lies what cars symbolize in american history and culture people grow very fond of their cars and are reluctant to part with them thus the need for repairs to keep them functioning well past their dumpyard date we think we can fix our car ourselves—with a little advice an owner feels proud that her car’s odometer registers  miles or if it approaches  as my  toyota did we’re determined to keep it running as i did whatever the cost until it cracks  no car owner likes to spend money on repairs either so tom and ray’s advice mustn’t require a lot of expense then there are the mechanical mysteries that emit from a car you know those rattles under the hood or the scraping below the passenger seat so we turn to cartalk to address our doubts or after our own local mechanic hasn’t performed a cure for our ailing  chevy pickup or our limping  honda civic \\nthe brothers seem to know every car model ever made from s vintage fords to the latest swedish chinese and indian brands after iding their location a caller starts with “i have a  volkswagen bus whose windshield wipers don’t work…” or “i and my husband are going to take cross country trip with our  dogs two rabbits and a parrot we can’t pay more than  and plan to dump the vehicle once we arrive what should we buy” tom and ray try to diagnose the issue and dispense advice injecting guidance with abundant hilarity while never never reproaching or ridiculing a caller the hour is upbeat always hilarious and the advice is highly reliable and it seems mostly spoton \\nthe personalities of the brothers and the chemistry between them explain much of cartalk ’s popularity but this program taps into our american romance with cars and our attachment to these celebrities of manufacturing history cars enjoy an unparalleled place in american life desoto mustang studebaker roadster impala– these names are deeply embedded in the american lexicon each represents an image fixed in our memory in the brains even of young people born long after a model ceased being manufactured cars represent key points in millions of americans’ lives in the latter  th century if not now famous songs eulogize cars cars are the subject of poems “motown” is the trope for detroit city center of auto manufacturing for decades and the music genre that emerged there \\na driving license not a pair of nike trainers or the latest iphone edition was and still is for many the primary goal of a us teenager we started saving for our first car even before we had our driver’s license cars compete with sports to occupy  of young men’s conversations we concocted quiz games about cars and car models there is an entire industry in the us devoted to auto museums small scale car models and road functional antique cars cars parked in residential driveways are part of american architecture in my town i recognize my neighbor by the color and model of their passing car we can usually gauge a person’s income by the model of their car \\nwhatever the caller’s car model one of the brother’s recognizes it— elcamino  ford torino  dodge viper  desoto adventurer or  volkswagen bus most callers seek advice for only  plus yearold vehicles these radio hosts seem to know any car’s mechanics and particularities that could cause problems instead of saying “take it to the junk yard it’s past  miles” they do their utmost to help extend its life they treat the car like it’s a family pet only occasionally tom would advise an owner—“it’s only a car”',\n",

investment officer of platinum and six others on charges related to a  billion fraud that led the firm to be operated “like a ponzi scheme” prosecutors said it is one of the largest such fraud cases since bernard l madoff’s investment firm unraveled in  david levy the firm’s   investment officer was also among those arrested in the morning by agents in texas manhattan and new rochelle a suburb of new york city the men were charged with securities fraud and investment adviser fraud according to an unsealed indictment filed in federal district court in brooklyn the securities and exchange commission filed a parallel civil case platinum tapped prominent families and foundations within the orthodox jewish community in new york to fuel   bets on payday lenders oil companies and even the terminally ill but prosecutors said these investments and the firm’s performance were misrepresented by its executives ultimately platinum took in new money in order to pay longtime investors who wanted their money back something the firm’s executives called among themselves “hail mary time ” “as investors sought redemptions the defendants engaged in numerous improper measures in an attempt to meet redemption requests including taking out   rate loans commingling monies among funds and raising money from new investors through fraudulent misrepresentations” said andrew j ceresney the director of the s e c ’s enforcement division located a few blocks from central park platinum founded in  made a splash early on with some of its investments in one bet the firm sought to profit from the death of terminally ill patients by investing in variable insurance payouts as part of the scheme a rabbi in los angeles sought out hospice patients to get their personal details that could be used to buy insurance payouts in their names a company that platinum set up to make the investments was fined by the s e c in january  “we definitely were exploiting a loophole but it was fully vetted by legal counsel” mr nordlicht said in an interview with bloomberg later that year in other bets platinum misled both investors and auditors  —   sometimes brazenly in december  for example executives misrepresented to auditors the value of black elk energy an oil and gas company controlled by platinum valuing it at  million prosecutors said in fact there had been an explosion on a black elk platform in the gulf of mexico the month before that had caused the deaths of three workers injuries to other employees and an oil spill black elk no longer exists jeffrey shulse who worked at black elk and is named in the government’s indictment denied the charges “mr shulse’s indictment is a clear case of overreaching” said f andino reynal mr shulse’s lawyer adding that his client was “confident that once a jury has had a chance to hear all the facts it will exonerate him of any wrongdoing ” lawyers for the defendants mr nordlicht daniel small uri landesman joseph mann and joseph san filippo did not respond to a request for comment michael sommer a lawyer for mr levy said he looked forward to “clearing david levy’s good name ” as recently as march platinum had   billion of investor money as of a march regulatory filing for years it reported a strong performance  —   with annual average returns of  percent as recent as last year platinum said it made gains of  percent a strong performance in a year when the average hedge fund lost   percent according to the hedge fund research composite index a gauge of industry performance platinum began to have trouble extracting investor money when some of its obscure investments started to sour according to prosecutors from  to  the firm could not stanch the losses in certain funds and the investor requests to withdraw money so it began to move money between funds in what mr nordlicht called a “big stew” the indictment said things seemed to reach a crisis point in june  prosecutors said “it can’t go on like this or practically we will need to wind down this is code red” mr nordlicht wrote to mr landesman a managing director at platinum at the time yet investors remained in the dark about the firm’s precarious liquidity position a month later when an investor emailed to ask about the reliability of platinum’s reported performance figures mr landesman replied “the numbers are all kosher they have had verbal input every month ” investors grew restless by march  the total amount they requested to withdraw from the firm exceeded  million eventually executives decided to pay some ahead of others prosecutors said “platinum partners purported to be a   in the hedge fund industry” said robert l capers the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york “in reality their returns were the result of the overvaluation of their largest assets ” this inflation led to mr nordlicht and others “operating platinum like a ponzi scheme where they used loans and new investor funds to pay off existing investors” mr capers added the arrests on monday were part of an investigation among several government agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and the united states postal inspection service in june murray huberfeld a former platinum executive was arrested he has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud soon after mr huberfeld’s arrest agents from the f b i and the postal

rebounds including two on the defensive end to go with  points and a blocked shot in a frenetic stretch over the next  minutes  seconds to help gonzaga to a   halftime lead by then karnowski was already in the locker room he could not open his right eye but those missed games from last season were enough for him he was back in the lineup at the start of the second half “the doctor said i’m good to go so i was just real happy about it” he said twice in the tournament south carolina had stormed back from halftime deficits and it would be no different against gonzaga the first two times thornwell was the spark this time it was silva who led the charge as the gamecocks tied the game at   and then took the lead on two free throws by rakym felder “that just showed the heart of a lion” few said adding “it took everything we had to hold on and come back ” cultivated though it has been gonzaga’s offense did have to deal with a dry spell the bulldogs stalled when karnowski’s teammates tried too often to force the ball inside to him leading to turnovers that the gamecocks turned into points at the other end but it was a storm the bulldogs could weather karnowski had  points in the second half to finish with  his understudy collins had a sensational second half with  points  rebounds and  blocked shots “we did a really good job i thought of just sticking together” karnowski said “that’s what we did the entire season we don’t have  wins for nothing ” as few and a handful of his players made their way up the steps to the   dais the moderator announced “gonzaga has arrived ” it

barack obama’s pick for the supreme court\\n\\nit’s a bold and understandable gambit designed to prevent a leftward lurch in jurisprudence after antonin scalia’s unexpected death this weekend but it could backfire badly\\n\\nassuming the president picks a hispanic african american or asian american – bonus points if she’s a woman – this could be exactly what democrats need to reactivate the obama coalition that fueled his victories in  and  even if he does not go with a minority candidate the cases on the docket will galvanize voters who are traditionally less likely to turn out\\n\\nget your campaign fix delivered directly to your email inbox with\\xa0the daily \\n\\nlast night in las vegas for example hillary clinton said it would be nakedly partisan and unconscionable if republicans don’t give a hearing to the president’s nominee and she emphasized the immigration case that the justices recently agreed to hear “because of his passing there will be most likely a tie four to four on important issues that affect so many people in our country” the democratic frontrunner said “and the most important is the decision about president obama’s actions under daca and dapa if there is no new justice appointed then as with other cases before the court the decision that was decided will stay in place and that was a bad decision”\\n\\nkeep in mind that a quarter of nevada’s population is hispanic beyond being a battleground in the presidential race there is also an open senate race to succeed harry reid democrats will nominate a latina and republicans will nominate a white guy who is already in congress\\n\\nor take abortion rights marco rubio is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest for women the prospect of roe v wade being overturned just became much more real “when i’m president of the united states i’ll nominate someone like justice scalia” the florida senator declared on the sunday shows\\n\\nand environmentalists just this month saw the court put a stay on obama’s clean power plan the next justice will be the swing vote who determines the future of coal in the united states though these sorts of cases mean that business interests will pour more money than ever into  races it could also help democrats attract crucial suburban women who might lean to the right\\xa0but worry about global warming\\n\\nmore broadly this could also undermine efforts by senate republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just “the party of no” make no mistake the upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the gop follows through on this threat democrats who are inclined to work with them promise to stop doing so if republicans play hardball\\n\\n ultimately though there is not really anything democrats can do procedurally to force judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley to hold a hearing on obama’s nominee the only lever they have is public pressure\\n\\nthe most potent pressure points are the seven gop incumbents who are up for reelection this year in states obama carried in  new hampshire’s kelly ayotte and wisconsin’s ron johnson publicly came out in favor of obstruction yesterday the others are holding their cards close to the vest for right now ohio’s rob portman praised scalia but would not address the core issue spokesmen for pennsylvania’s pat toomey declined to comment and illinois’ mark kirk ignored inquiries per cnn\\n\\npay particularly close attention to portman who is already vulnerable and could be wiped out if african americans make up the same percentage of the electorate in  as they did in  they are likelier to vote if they believe he is disrespecting the first black president\\n\\n“i intend to continue to talk about this until the polls close” former ohio gov ted strickland the democratic candidate against portman told my colleague paul kane yesterday “senator portman who has your allegiance your country or your party leaders … the people have spoken on two occasions” he added referring to obama’s  and  victories\\n\\n conventional wisdom is that whichever party wins the white house in november will control the senate that’s obviously the primary factor but we’re not convinced it will be determinative democrats need to pick up four seats to win the senate and it’s conceivable they could get those from states that clinton would probably carry even if she loses the electoral college in  it’s worth recalling democrats lost each of the seven seats they had to defend in states mitt romney had carried two years earlier\\n\\nand remember that this won’t be happening in a vacuum if obama knows for sure that his pick is not going to get formally considered he can go with someone who gives his party maximum political leverage to bludgeon these republican incumbents monica márquez is the first latina and first openly gay justice on the supreme court in colorado which will again be a crucial swing state attorney general loretta lynch is an african american woman

chamber – more than it does liberals and they don’t think independents will really care all that much it will just sound like more washington noise\\xa0mcconnell not a favorite of the grassroots also needs to keep his own base ginned up amidst a presidential primary it is untenable for republicans to look like rubber stamps for obama\\n\\nchris christie offers a cautionary tale for gop members his bubble in new hampshire was punctured when opponents began attacking him for offering support of sonia sotomayor while he was running for governor of new jersey in  christie denied making comments he had made allies and rivals agree that the sotomayor hit was a turning point for his campaign republicans who fear primary challenges such as alabama’s richard shelby are never going to back any obama nominee\\n\\nmost smart republicans in dc still believe either trump or cruz would lose a general election their hope is that a supreme court vacancy might help galvanize conservative volunteers to go do work for endangered senate incumbents\\n\\n to be sure not every democrat has a clean nose on this harry reid shortsightedly invoked the nuclear option in  which allows nonsupreme court judges to be approved by a simple majority this incensed republicans and only accelerated the upper chamber’s decline to be more like the unruly house\\n\\nlindsey graham one of just two current gop senators who voted to confirm elena kagan during obama’s first term tells the post that reid poisoned the well by going nuclear “i voted for every supreme court justice nominated by bush and obama i believe the senate should be deferential to qualified picks” the south carolina senator said “but i did tell harry reid and the president that the consequence of changing the rules in the senate to pack the court will come back to haunt them”\\n\\ngeorge f will also zeroes in on reid’s use of the nuclear option in his column today which he describes as “institutional vandalism” he frames the battle this way “scalia’s death will enkindle a debate missing from this year’s presidential campaign a debate discomfiting for some conservatives do they want a passive court that is deferential to legislative majorities and to presidents who claim untrammeled powers deriving from national majorities or do they want a court actively engaged in defending liberty’s borders against unjustified encroachments by majorities”\\n\\n the big question right now will there even be a confirmation hearing\\n\\nmcconnell’s saturday night statement declaring that the vacancy should be filled by the next president did not rule out the possibility of a confirmation hearing or floor time to consider whoever the president picks\\n\\nthat might be the more politically astute play since republicans could slow walk the vetting trickle out negative revelations about the nominee to rightwing media outlets and then ultimately vote to reject the nominee\\n\\nhaving hearings could give some cover to purple state republicans to say they are doing their jobs “if the republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing i think that is going to guarantee theyre going to lose control of the senate said patrick leahy the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee\\n\\nplus even if obama’s pick gets past the judiciary committee they will be hard pressed to get confirmed by the full senate fourteen republicans would need to come out against cruz’s promised filibuster during obama’s first term when democrats held a near supermajority only nine republicans voted for sotomayor and five voted for kagan\\n\\ngiven that the senate is on a president’s day recess white house spokesman eric schultz said obama will not rush out an announcement this week this gives both sides a few days to poll and focus group their options\\n\\na former top adviser to the president says the gop could have been savvier\\n\\n another wildcard how will the press cover this one of the mainstream media’s problems is a really short attention span what is unknowable today is whether this vacancy is a twoweek story a twomonth story or a month story also is the narrative that republicans are creating an unprecedented constitutional crisis or is it played as a boring hesaid hesaid storyline\\n\\ndemocrats note that obama still has the bully pulpit so he can come up with creative ways to drive news coverage about the gop’s failure to bring his nominee up for a vote the party can also use paid media to target the vulnerable republican incumbents\\n\\n for both sides it really is difficult to overstate the stakes scalia left an indelible mark on both the court and our country for nearly three decades and his replacement could do the same ironically if clinton wins and democrats retake the senate after mcconnell spends the year taking heat she will have a mandate to put the most progressive justice imaginable on the bench and republicans will have no real grounds to oppose her for mcconnell right now that’s a risk worth taking\\n\\nthe buzz at the capitol “some hopeful democrats now see the nomination of a sitting senator as the best chance obama has to seat another justice on the supreme court before leaving office” juliet eilperin and paul kane report “there are several senate democrats who fit that description including amy klobuchar minn sheldon whitehouse ri christopher a coons del and richard j durbin ill but individuals who have spoken with the white house about the nomination process … said the president is interested in a candidate who is young enough to serve an extended period of time only two of those senators — klobuchar at  and coons at  — are younger than  the age justice ruth bader ginsburg was when she was nominated”\\n\\n… but we hear that potus is more likely to go with someone who has already been confirmed and vetted “although obama has installed fewer federal appellate judges than either presidents clinton or george w bush he has put enough nominees on the bench that democratic appointees are in the majority on nine of the nation’s  circuit courts” juliet and paul note “in that group the th circuit’s paul j watford a yearold african american and sri srinivasan a yearold judge on us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit who would be the first southasian american on the supreme court would be the leading contenders others include the dc circuit’s patricia ann millett  and jane l kelly  a judge on the th circuit who was confirmed  to ” with the support of grassley\\n\\n what does the loss of scalia mean for cases currently on the docket “in the short term conservatives could still prevail on many of the cases before the court this term but the wins could come in the form of tie votes that preserve the status quo rather than provide precedents that will shape the future” writes robert barnes our supreme court correspondent\\n\\na big break for public employee unions “at oral arguments the court seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of california teachers who claim that their freespeech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the state’s teachers union the court’s conservatives — scalia included — appeared ready to junk a yearold precedent that allows unions to collect an ‘agency fee’ from nonmembers to support collectivebargaining activities for members and nonmembers alike but the us court of appeals for the th circuit citing that precedent had ruled for the union and with the supreme court’s liberals seemingly united in upholding the precedent a to vote would mean the union victory would stand”\\n\\nthe law could be interpreted differently in different regions “for instance a texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion providers was found constitutional by a panel of the us court of appeals for the th circuit a to tie would uphold that finding but a similar law in wisconsin was struck down and would be unaffected by the court’s tie in the texas case”\\n\\nbarnes adds that if republican leaders hold firm it will also affect which cases the justices choose to take up when the next term starts in october read a breakdown of how four cases will likely be impacted here\\n\\n chaos confusion and conflicting reports in the hours after scalia’s death which happened during a blue quail hunting trip from lana straub eva ruth moravec sari horwitz and jerry markon after his body was discovered it took hours for authorities in remote west texas to find a justice of the peace “when they did she pronounced scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decided not to order an autopsy a second justice of the peace who was called but couldn’t get to scalia’s body in time said she would have ordered an autopsy ‘if it had been me \\u2009\\u2009 i would want to know’ juanita bishop a justice of the peace in presidio tex told the washington post in an interview sunday”\\n\\nsome details of his final hours at the cibolo creek ranch a luxury compound less than an hour from the mexican border remain opaque “as late as sunday afternoon there were conflicting

the primary season a day after a debate marked by personal petty exchanges republicans were grappling with their core beliefs as well as the image they were broadcasting to the country … the increasingly harsh discussions of these and other issues amount to an existential crisis within the republican party and reflect the growing influence of nonideological populist voters contenders are making their most concerted effort yet to stop trump in south carolina even though previous attempts to take him down have attained little the escalating quarreling may increase the likelihood of a

they shared new year’s eves with their families and friends in  when chief justice roberts announced ginsburg’s husband marty’s death from the bench scalia wiped tears from his eyes … whether or not

       " 'in era of trump china’s president champions economic globalization  the new york times davos switzerland  —   in a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade security and the mission to limit climate change president xi jinping of china on tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration that a leader of the people’s republic of china can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months his message delivered here in the swiss alps at the annual gathering of the world economic forum appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand he was speaking three days before donald j trump was to be inaugurated president of the united states raising the prospect of a trade war with china and on the same day that prime minister theresa may of britain outlined plans to pursue her country’s departure from the european union the chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity he never mentioned mr trump by name nor did he even make reference to the fact that the white house is about to gain a new occupant yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the   has promised  —   not least his repeated threat of steep tariffs on chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices in myriad ways mr xi is a strikingly   steward of openness and connectivity under his direction china’s communist party has clamped down severely on civil society tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country’s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people he has projected china’s navy into contested waters in the south china and east china seas throughout his speech mr xi carefully used the phrase “economic globalization” while avoiding unqualified “globalization” reflecting china’s spurning of an open internet universal human rights and free elections indeed the metaphor he used to reject protectionism  —   “like locking oneself in a dark room”  —   could just as well have been used to describe china’s political path under his leadership with the communist party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels western notions such as democracy this month china’s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary which he said must be “resolutely rejected ” not for nothing china carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests steel producers around the globe complain that beijing dumps its  steel on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials costing jobs at mills from italy to indiana but the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible in the united states the supposed citadel of free market enterprise a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the white house on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of   workers here in davos where technology executives fret about the plight of   africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks the chairman of the communist party of china  —   an institution that rules in the name of   revolution  —   draped himself in the banner of globalization none of these details were featured in mr xi’s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite for klaus schwab executive chairman of the world economic forum the participation of china’s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a chinese head of state had attended mr schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment he asked no questions solicited none from the audience and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience “in a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility the international community is looking to china to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability” mr schwab said that mr xi chose this year to make his debut underscores china’s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil the united states is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades from nato to the world trade organization britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the european union dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems the growing electoral strength of populist   union parties in france the netherlands italy and germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure these developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision mr xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum casting china as a trustworthy power in which   people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges  —   from climate change to a weak global economy “this appears to be a time of uncertainty in the united states in the u k” said   lee a prominent venture capitalist in beijing who invests in emerging chinese companies “the world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence ” in keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior chinese officials mr xi’s address was long on platitudes tortured metaphors and literary references while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements yet in totality it delivered a striking message in an era in which the united states and britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization china will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade mr trump has picked as a key trade adviser the economist peter navarro who has long portrayed china as a mortal threat to american prosperity mr trump has threatened to brand the country a currency manipulator opening the door to punitive tariffs though beijing has in years past maintained its currency the renminbi at artificially low levels to make its goods cheap on world markets it has in recent months intervened aggressively in the other direction propping up its value against the dollar “china has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the rmb” mr xi said in another implicit rebuke of mr trump the chinese president argued forcefully for   on the  paris climate accord mr trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change “the paris agreement was hard won“ mr xi said “all signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations ” mr xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage posing for photos as they awaited the president’s arrival in conversations on the sidelines many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming trump administration fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies but most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests china relies on access to the united states the largest consumer market on earth as the landing place for its exports the united states depends upon china for a vast range of finished goods jack ma founder and executive chairman of alibaba group the chinese   giant said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities “i don’t think it will happen” he said of the hostilities “it’s going to be a disaster if it does ” more than a decade has passed since the united states congress effectively prevented cnooc a chinese   oil company from buying the american energy company unocal branding the merger a threat to national security fu chengyu cnooc’s chief executive at that time pointed to the treatment of the merger as an indication of american hypocrisy on free trade but on tuesday as he waited for the chinese president to deliver his address mr fu who recently retired from another major chinese energy company but retains a party post expressed confidence that mr xi and mr trump would forge common ground “eventually they will cooperate to get more benefits” mr fu said “at the beginning trump will say something very harsh he will try to do something punishing but this is a   sword once he’s in the white house he will see things differently ”',\n",

       " 'miles of algae and a multitude of hazards  the new york times the stench of decaying algae began rising from coastal waterways in southeastern florida early this month shutting down businesses and beaches during a critical tourism season officials arrived surveyed the toxic muck and declared states of emergency in four counties residents shook their heads then their fists organizing rallies and haranguing local officials in truth there was little they could do the disaster that engulfed the st lucie river and its estuary had been building for weeks in may a    algal bloom crept over lake okeechobee the vast headwaters of the everglades after an unseasonably wet winter the army corps of engineers was forced to discharge water from the lake to lower water levels flushing the ooze along channels to the east and west until it coagulated along the shores of the famed treasure coast the mess in florida is only the latest in a string of algal blooms that some experts believe are increasing in frequency and in severity an immense plume of   algae last september covered a   stretch of the ohio river a month earlier the city of toledo ohio warned more than   residents to avoid drinking tap water after toxic algae spread over an intake in lake erie indeed the lake erie bloom is now an annual event almost exactly a year before the florida bloom another stretching   square miles washed ashore in qingdao china a popular beach destination government officials called in hundreds of boats and bulldozers to remove it the green blob appeared again earlier this month the largest and most dangerous algal bloom ever recorded which ranged from central california to british columbia produced high levels of a toxin that last year closed crab and clam fisheries along the west coast “the season didn’t open for four and a half months which meant slip rents went unpaid house payments went unpaid guys were having trouble getting groceries to feed their families” said tim sloane the executive director of the pacific coast federation of fishermen’s associations algae is a catchall term referring to a wide variety of aquatic organisms that generally rely on photosynthesis for energy and reproduction   algae are cyanobacteria for instance while red tide is composed of tiny dinoflagellates seaweed is a sophisticated alga as is kelp blooms are a natural occurrence according to dr william cochlan a senior research scientist at san francisco state university native americans for centuries knew to avoid bioluminescent water scientists would later discover that the glow was caused by dinoflagellates that also produce a hazardous neurotoxin many algal species produce similar toxins when vast blooms occur these poisons may spread through the environment and up the food chain to fish and animals that feed on them cyanobacteria produce microcystins for example which can affect the liver and can be deadly to humans  —   one reason toledo banned the drinking water although they occur naturally algal blooms are being intensified by human activity in ways that scientists are still trying to quantify chief among the culprits runoff from farms feedlots and municipal sewer systems “the bloom itself is the visual manifestation of nutrient overenrichment in lakes” said tim davis an ecologist at the national oceanic and atmospheric agency’s great lakes environmental research laboratory in ann arbor mich “in freshwater systems both nitrogen and phosphorus are the main nutrients ” in florida and the great lakes nitrogen and phosphorus come mainly from fertilizers used in large farming operations along with septic tanks manure and storm water scientists have been aware of the nutrient problem for decades it’s partly why phosphorus was removed from laundry detergents the vast algal bloom in the pacific last year was also fed in part by el niño the mass of warm water that forms periodically off the west coast but   climate change may also be playing a role some experts say warming atmospheric temperatures and wetter weather in some parts of the country increase the   runoff into streams lakes and the ocean and as ice melts in the arctic sea temperatures are rising and more sunlight is filtering into the ocean “some of the features of climate change such as warmer ocean temperatures and increased light availability through the loss of sea ice in the arctic are making conditions more favorable for phytoplankton growth  —   both toxic and nontoxic algae  —   in more regions and farther north” kathi lefebvre a biologist at noaa’s northwest fisheries science center in seattle wrote in an email “it is likely that toxic blooms will continue to increase and expand as these features of climate change continue” she added dr davis said he also believed that climate change was working against efforts to prevent algal blooms “i certainly believe as a scientist that climate change will influence the size and intensity of these blooms” he said “if nothing changes  —   the increase of rainfall the increase nutrient loads warmer water  —   all of this could lead to larger blooms that last longer and are more toxic ” florida’s crisis is only the most recent example dr cochlan of san francisco state university said  —   yet no new funds have been appropriated at the federal or state levels to study the growth and toxicity in these blooms despite their increasing impact throughout the country in a letter to president obama on july  florida legislators asked for federal funding to avert further disaster back in  florida voters approved amendment  setting aside an estimated  million in the program’s first year for the state to buy agricultural land south of lake okeechobee as a new pathway for discharge into the everglades the hope was that the ecosystem would provide a natural filter for algae and other contaminants as it once did but in the end the state decided not to buy the land instead sparring with environmental protection agency over its efforts to enforce the federal clean water act “a lot of this has to do with legislation all the way from the watershed down into the lake” dr davis said “it needs to be a mutual effort on all sides the more we understand about the blooms the more we can do to reduce their impact ”',\n",

way… so—so we’re going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that i think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first americans… – president obama on the now this news website  november   i sn’t that sweet the president gave lip service to “the traditions of the first americans” he didn’t mention treaties between sovereign nations of course because he’s not about to break with the traditions of the second americans that such treaties are only a means to a genocidal end and aren’t to be taken seriously by the united states of exceptional manifestly destined americans whenever such treaties interfere with what the us wants that’s what “properly attentive” means historically freely translated “properly attentive” means “make a show of peace talk them roll over them with whatever force necessary after it’s too late to affect the election” the legal mind is nothing if not properly attentive to elegant turns of phrase in its unyielding hypocrisy if the president had any intention of honoring anything relating to the sacred lands of native americans he would not be planning to “let it play out for several more weeks” sacred lands have already been destroyed sacred lands are being destroyed no not only by the pipeline construction but also by the massive militarized police response to nonviolent protest letting it play out for several more weeks only opens the door to the destruction of more – even all – of the sacred lands in the path of this lethaltotheplanet pipeline what is happening what has been happening for months in north dakota  is a travesty – of justice of common human decency of the rule of law and standards of international law and our president is on the wrong side of all of it just barely responding in his docile passive articulate evasiveness “we’re monitoring this closely” says the president i f the president is monitoring this closely and remains willing to let it play out for several more weeks that’s a pretty clear signal that he has no serious problem with the creation of police state conditions in north dakota besides an unknown number of private security forces working for energy transfer partners the pipeline sponsor there are law enforcement officers from at least seven states that have cost about  million so far that seems a ridiculously high price to pay to contain peaceful protest and it’s an even more ridiculous price for taxpayers to shell out to protect private profits if the president is monitoring this closely without responding that is a tacit admission that he has no serious problem with any of the egregious behavior so far by official and quasiofficial paramilitaries and their wideranging mistreatment apparently including criminal assault of american citizens in particular he has allowed and continues to allow himself to be seen as approving unlicensed apparently untrained private security forces using dogs to bloody peaceful protesters who call themselves water protectors state officials arresting and overcharging journalists for committing journalism a local sheriff inflaming the public with false reports of “pipe bombs” when what he had actually heard was talk of “peace pipes” law officers shooting nonviolent water protectors in the back and front with rubber bullets state officials housing arrestees in dog cages and conditions that violate international law against torturing prisoners law officers on the riverbank using mace and pepper spray against nonviolent water protectors standing in the water official surveillance helicopters flying low to panic horses official surveillance helicopters mysteriously going off duty just before “persons unknown” start a prairie fire with such ineptitude that the wind blows it away from the standing rock sioux gathering ground apparent contempt of court by energy transfer partners who sent its bulldozers to destroy a burial ground that once destroyed could no longer be a reason for a federal court to rule against the pipeline desecration is not a criminal act apparently when you have a government permit for it even when that permit is under litigation that’s a lot of official abuse to tolerate even for a president and that’s just a sampling of the police state techniques being tested in middle america these days “and i think that right now the army corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline in a way …” t he president paused there leaving the thought unfinished the pipeline has already been rerouted away from the state capital city of bismarck after residents there expressed fear that the pipeline threatened their water supply now the pipeline threatens the water supply of the standing rock sioux and thousands of others but that is more acceptable to the american power structure the president has expressed no dismay at the idea that a pipeline rupture along the missouri river would devastate huge numbers of “the first americans” who have no other source of water as one water protector put it  “if it were to be contaminated… it would be a death sentence” why does the president think rerouting a climatehostile pipeline is any kind of an answer to anything other than protecting the speculative bets of energy transfer partners if he were to consider this pipeline any new pipeline in terms of its impact on global climate values this would be a nobrainer no more pipelines this is the army corps of engineers we’re talking about – the army – and the president is the commander in chief who has no difficulty blowing up wedding parties and funerals with drones in some imaginary defense of national security why does he have such reluctance to protect planetary security why does he not just order the army corp of engineers to go back to square one and redo this process which was fasttracked in the first place for reasons that remain murky and with the exclusion of interested parties with legal standing but president obama on full salary as he campaigns for hillary clinton shows no inclination to do any of this well or right he’s apparently much more confortable with false equivalencies and blaming the victims also on now this news yeah i mean it’s a challenging situation i think that my general rule when i talk to governors and state and local officials whenever they’re dealing with protests including for example during the black lives matters protests is there is an obligation for protesters to be peaceful and there’s an obligation for authorities to show restraint and you know i want to make sure that as everybody is exercising their constitutional rights to be heard that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt for someone supposedly monitoring this closely the president might be expected to know that people have already been hurt and most if not all of those hurt were nonviolent peaceful protestors set upon by dogs and assaulted by rubber bullets sound cannons and chemical weapons what fundamental callous irrationality prompts this president to bring in black lives matter that is strange beyond comprehension but perhaps it shines a light on that dark place in his soul that allowed him to react with almost no help or pity for the people of flint poisoned by their own governments including the

china sea as a potential flashpoint trump’s secretary of state nominee rex tillerson threw out an explosive challenge to beijing on wednesday by calling for it be denied access to artificial islands it is building in the strategic waterway a trump transition adviser told reuters that tillerson trump’s pick to be america’s top diplomat did not mean to suggest the new administration would impose a naval blockade which would risk armed confrontation with china something the new administration was not seeking but another official authorized to speak on behalf of the transition team pushed back on that view saying tillerson “did not misspeak” when he said china should be barred from its manmade islands amid the conflicting signals on policy the team appears to be making progress on plans for a major naval buildup in east asia to counter china’s rise  the transition adviser told reuters about specifics under consideration such as basing a second aircraft carrier in the region deploying more destroyers attack submarines and missile defense batteries and expanding or adding new bases in japan and australia   they are also looking at installing “air force longrange strike assets” in south korea bordering china’s nucleararmed neighbor north korea said the adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity trump who succeeds president barack obama on jan  has vowed to greatly expand the us navy to  ships but his transition team has not made clear how he will fund this amid other massive spending plans  china’s foreign ministry said it could not guess what tillerson meant by his remarks which came after trump questioned washington’s longstanding and highly sensitive “onechina” policy over taiwan but an influential chinese staterun tabloid warned on friday that blocking chinese access to south china sea islands would require the united states to “wage war” trump’s pick for defense secretary retired marine general james mattis did not endorse tillerson’s message on the south china sea which would seem at odds with washington’s own longstanding commitment to freedom of navigation for all asked about the remarks at his confirmation hearing on thursday mattis said china’s actions in the south china sea were part of a broader attack on the world order but said the state defense and treasury departments needed to put together an integrated policy “so we are not dealing with an incomplete or an incoherent\\xa0strategy”  the conflicting messages underscore the incoming administration’s struggle in crafting an approach to one of the biggest foreign policy challenges facing trump who during his election campaign repeatedly bashed china saying it was “killing” and “raping” america on trade a former us official who has informally advised trump’s transition team said it may not have fully thought through the risks of any new us military or trade pressure on china “we should not underestimate china’s willingness to retaliate in kind” the former official who spoke on condition of anonymity told reuters as part of a drive to protect american jobs trump has threatened to declare china a currency manipulator  even though economists say beijing has been seeking to prop up not weaken  its currency he has also threatened to slap punitive tariffs on chinese goods risking a trade war that could hurt both countries and the global economy trump has yet to name to his national security team highlevel members with deep experience of the region leading some analysts to question whether the new administration will have enough expertise to translate rhetoric on a more robust asia policy into action but trump has appointed two harsh china critics to his trade team  peter navarro an academic who authored a book entitled “death by china” and robert lighthizer a former reagan administration official trump advisers dismiss concerns their approach could prove risky or counterproductive arguing that a “peace through strength” stance will put real muscle behind us policy in the region after decades of underresourcing due to us distractions elsewhere in the world “once we start correcting the military imbalance i actually think you will get more cooperation rather than less” the trump adviser said trump and his cabinet nominees have also vowed to step up pressure on china to rein in north korea’s nuclear and missile programs including by holding out the possibility of “secondary sanctions” on chinese entities found to be violating sanctions on pyongyang but analysts say china may be in no mood to cooperate if washington is leaning on it on other issues those include us  pressure on beijing to curb cyber hacking of us entities china’s official responses to recent broadsides have been measured so far as they wait to see how trump will act once he takes office “we have seen many conflicting messages from people within his prospective administration” said tu xinquan a trade expert at beijing’s university of international business and economics  but analysts say confronting beijing over hotbutton nationalist issues like taiwan and the south china sea could trigger strong reactions especially in a year when president xi jinping is seeking to further consolidate power at a  congress of the ruling communist party held every five years zha daojiong a professor at peking university said the theme of clash of civilizations was becoming increasingly popular in chinese circles and this was ominous “this does not bode well at all  and it means that the continued war drums from america on the south china sea would not help

five years at public colleges and more than double that at private ones after five years only  percent of students at public colleges have graduated the remaining students will have racked up absurdly high expenses on the way to earning or not earning a degree for them regardless of what   background they come from time away from campus seems prudent i certainly wasn’t alone in failing to think carefully before committing to college i sometimes took three trips a day to the beach with other students by second semester most of my friends were less concerned with final exams than with finding the coolest house the fewest steps from the beach to live in the following year and i would have been too if i had stayed i was already failing at least one class and although my grades were not poor enough to be asked to leave school i had lost the motivation to do anything but fulfill the minimum course requirements i felt guilty for wasting so much money and i couldn’t see doing the same thing for three more years although i appreciated my parents’ support i also recognized the extent to which it had become detrimental their attempts to eliminate any possibility of real failure had guaranteed its own kind of failure financial dependence had enabled me to make a major life decision the decision to go to college without taking personal ownership of it i had managed to avoid thinking about why a degree mattered to me or how i hoped it would enrich my life when applying to colleges i had put down whatever fluff my high school counselors suggested for my admissions essays and was accepted by a few schools whose campus scenery had attracted me far more than the course offerings a gap year presented itself as a chance to claim the independence that formalized education had not encouraged it was an opportunity to discover a sense of purpose outside of school to prompt some thinking on those questions before graduating without classes and the path to a degree as a crutch that gave structure to my days i’d be forced to create a structure of my own but my father wasn’t convinced that a gap year was the right decision he let me know that if i left school i wouldn’t receive any financial support at the time i viewed this as a threat now i see it as a first step toward allowing me the freedom i needed i knew this wasn’t an easy concession for him the dependence that many parents encourage  —   throughout college and even after their children leave home  —   is now commonplace in her book “parenting to a degree” the sociologist laura t hamilton documents cases in which a parent comes to the rescue with homework help or buys a daughter clothes so she fits in better with her sorority sisters what’s often lost in these stories  —   and the predictable rants on the negative effects of helicopter parenting  —   is the question of what responsibility children have as they get older to put an end to patterns of dependency it was difficult making a clean break from those patterns to figure out what i wanted to do for the unstructured year ahead most of the information i found on gap years was written for parents by parents it seemed to miss the point at least the point as i saw it to loosen the parental grip so that students can develop an educational framework of their own while working summer jobs to save money i found an internship at surfer magazine in orange county and reported for duty in late august i slept in my car the first two nights and rinsed off in the ocean before work until i found an affordable place to rent and because the internship was unpaid a job at a   store where i could work evenings as i quickly learned a food store that defines itself by what it doesn’t have tends to attract a   clientele i took turns providing customers with my   and stocking shelves which i did with a recent college graduate who could not find employment that put his degree to good use and with a woman who claimed to hate the taste of water so much that she drank only juice this wasn’t the kind of job i wanted to hold for the rest of my working days showing up at the store after a day at surfer where the editors had some level of engagement with the tasks at hand prompted career reflection like never before it was refreshing after a school year filled with so much apathy to meet people who seemed to actually care about their work at the same time entering the work force made the burden of assuming debt  —   and my own privileged ability to attend college free of loans  —   visible in ways that continuing on in school would have never allowed i came to realize what it meant to take a college education for granted aside from opportunities for unpaid internships i found few   options for learning experiences during my gap year according to the nonprofit american gap association about  percent of students in the united states take gap years by contrast in australia and certain european countries gap years are encouraged as part of the educational process  percent of students in the united kingdom participate in a gap year according to one study by its department of education more colleges in the united states are encouraging applicants to consider a “bridge” year before enrolling and many independent programs and some campuses  —   like florida state university the university of north carolina at chapel hill princeton and tufts  —   even offer fellowships and financial aid ethan knight the executive director at the american gap association still sees the need for greater support to encourage a more diverse set of students to participate “you can get access to pell funding to go to beauty school” he said “there’s certainly as much learning to be had in a gap year as there is in beauty school so why shouldn’t students be able to earn access to pell and other government grants for certain gap year experiences” mr knight pointed to   opportunities that could be valuable such as traveling abroad to learn languages that the state department views as critical but federal grants are contingent on receiving college credit making them unavailable to anyone taking a year off school in its own way my limited options became a rewarding educational challenge in the winter i moved to puerto rico scrubbed dishes in a locally owned hotel restaurant for  an hour found a used car for  and shared a   for  a month i ate leftovers off dirty dishes in the restaurant i cleaned the deep fryers the   garbage bins and the vomit left in the bathrooms by   east coast vacationers all the other employees at the restaurant spoke in spanish and i was perceived as dumb for not speaking fluently i’d seen the same thing happen at home to   whose first language was not english although it had never fully registered until our roles were reversed experiencing these humiliations was a lot easier knowing i had the freedom to leave at any time still it poked holes in my comfort with and blindness to some of the inequalities i had grown up with making them harder to ignore when i left the restaurant behind and i did leave the restaurant behind as soon as i had saved enough money to travel for a few months i bought a plane ticket to indonesia rented a motorbike there and traveled island to island by ferry the trip was not without its mishaps to name a few i was bitten by a monkey got in a motorbike accident lost a good amount of skin on my hands chest back legs and feet in numerous brushes with coral while surfing got a raging ear infection surfing too close to a polluted river mouth after it rained i did not want my parents to worry and so i took care to avoid mentioning these hiccups in sporadic calls and emails home from bali lombok sumbawa java and sumatra what i did mention to my parents much to their satisfaction was that i actually looked forward to returning to college in the fall time free from the obligations of schoolwork had enabled me to realize my passion for writing and to apply this to an english major where i would discover the most formative classes and professors of my education with this newfound interest i experienced many of the benefits that gap years are said to provide studies show that students who take time off before graduating increase their   averages drink less when in college and go on to find more fulfilling career paths it also helped me graduate in only two and a half more years  —   one semester behind where i should have if i’d stayed in school after graduating too i found satisfying work for a few years editing a surf magazine looking back though it would be hard to identify anything from that year as a formula for success but that was exactly the point i stocked shelves scrubbed dishes did an unpaid internship and traveled my performance in school did improve afterward but if i’d thought about chasing those results or recommended those experiences to others there’s just no way the same benefits would follow while there’s certainly a place for making those kinds of calculations a gap year was about removing those expectations at least temporarily it was a time when education ceased to be an act of dependence an act of fulfilling my parents’ wishes only then could the act of graduating from college become a move toward independence only then could i make space for education to have value of its own',\n",

the theme song to “the west wing” kicked in from the orchestra pit mr miranda giggled and took a couple of shy bows only to turn around and be embraced then pushed back to the front of the stage by christopher jackson who plays george washington for a proper bow still the curtain call lasted no more than two and a half minutes despite fervent applause which had been consistent throughout the night the opening number received multiple standing ovations as did many others but mr miranda and other performers would pause for only a minute each time before moving the show forward afterward in the pouring rain hundreds and hundreds of fans filled west th street waiting for mr miranda to emerge from the stage door at the richard rodgers theater instead mr miranda appeared “evita”  on a balcony atop the theater’s marquee holding an umbrella and waving to fans he paced from one side of the marquee to the other occasionally stopping to hold his left hand over his heart to show gratitude then he was gone “it’s over folks” a police officer yelled as he tried to keep the crowd out of the street “there’s no more ” despite the rain many people were reluctant to leave greeting other cast members at the stage door and holding out for another possible appearance by mr miranda inside he had gotten his hair cut now that he no longer needed it long for the role fans had begun to

wisconsin will see their tax credits decrease under obamacare   “if you’re a    making   a year you’re going to get a  percent or higher increase to your tax credits —  a beneficial situation for you” the post explains “if however you’re a    making   a year you’re going to see a reduction in those tax credits unless you live in upstate new york or massachusetts or parts of central texas ”  in other words senior citizens —  who vote regularly in   elections —  will see their healthcare costs increase under the republicans’ bill plus obamacare   phases out credits for people who start earning more than   why because screw the voters and they’re on their own what a great message to send to the middle class not only are republicans hurting people struggling to make ends meet they also punish you if you make too much money everyone loses except perhaps insurance companies  meanwhile the bill is “a gift to illegal aliens” as conservative author daniel horowitz writes illegals can get health care through identity theft and fraud because obamacare   makes it impossible to check enrollees’ immigration status the bill incentivizes further illegal immigration by encouraging illegals to come to the u s to cut into   programs meant for citizens poll after poll shows trump’s immigration policies prioritizing americans and their problems over foreigners and their wants are hugely popular with voters giving away health care to illegals while ramping up the price for trump’s core voters is a slap in the face  obamacare   will be labeled as “trumpcare” and democrats and their media allies will highlight every hard case to attack republicans for hurting the poor and elderly remember when a progressive group put out an ad showing paul ryan pushing a grandma in a wheelchair off a cliff obamacare   gives the media and the democrats a golden opportunity to walk away from their healthcare mess and blame republicans and amplify that message endlessly  republicans kicked things off with horrific messaging in a condescending statement utah republican rep jason chaffetz told americans they’ll have to “invest” in their health care instead of getting a new iphone “americans have choices” he said on cnn “and they’ve got to make a choice and so maybe rather than getting that new iphone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on maybe they should invest it in their own health care they’ve got to make those decisions for themselves ” being forced to buy a product that doesn’t deliver adequate care and keeps increasing in price year after year isn’t an “investment” for one   pointed out that chaffetz was mocking poor people who get blindsided by a health crisis “if   families make the wrong series of choices forcing them to choose between their health and their finances that’s on them how’s that for a winning message” the huffington post immediately splashed a photo of chaffetz pointing his finger at the viewer chaffetz later walked back his comments but the damage was done they sound especially bad in light of obamacare  ’s “continuous coverage” provision  the arbitrary and crushing penalty for not enrolling during the   period will hurt financially struggling voters already fighting to stay afloat as avik roy writes in forbes the “continuous coverage” part inflicts a massive cost increase on those who go without paying for a plan for more than  days “worse still the bill contains an arbitrary ‘continuous coverage’ provision in which those who sign up for coverage outside of the normal open enrollment period would pay a  percent surcharge to the normal insurance premium” roy writes and you have to pay this for an entire year —  which will not go over well with people struggling to pay for rent for childcare for student loans in other words it’s not enough to pay a   penalty if you forget to sign up for your obamacare   in time or choose to forgo insurance altogether no you have to pay  percent more on top of rising costs for a whole year how is this supposed to help say parents with three kids paying a large monthly premium not counting eye and dental of course with a high deductible  this bill is going to unleash the kind of political fury on republicans that will elect elizabeth warren in  part of what killed hillary clinton’s campaign was voters getting their massive obamacare premium increases in the mail in october republicans seem eager to inflict that kind of fatal damage on themselves the explosive reaction to obamacare launched the tea party in  and swept republicans into congress during the   elections of  the left is furious and energetic under trump the  midterm elections are right around the corner and democrats are going to launch a holy war against trump during the  election the left will rally around massachusetts democratic sen elizabeth warren and other progressives and portray the democrats as the party of the forgotten man the white working class gave trump a chance in  they could easily begin voting democratic again or drop out of the political process altogether after a healthcare betrayal  it destroys political capital desperately needed for the rest of trump’s first term particularly   immigration reform trump’s election victory wasn’t a     election it was     or    republicans have one brief chance to correct the course the u s is heading down and bind up all of the wounds inflicted on americans over the decades there is a small window to end the era of cheap labor low wages mass immigration   communities family disintegration drug addiction and suicide will republicans take it and secure their party’s dominance for the next  years or will they throw it away sixty percent of adults are “hopeful and optimistic” about america’s future that’s a precious opportunity one that shouldn’t be wasted “the issue now is about americans looking to not get f —  ed over if we deliver we’ll get  percent of the white vote and

with close ties to president tayyip erdogan has been charged in an investigation that has strained ties between washington and ankara exminister zafer caglayan was also charged with taking bribes in cash and jewelry worth tens of millions of dollars the charges stem from the case against reza zarrab a wealthy turkishiranian gold trader who was arrested in the united states over sanctions evasion last year erdogan has said us authorities had  ulterior motives  in charging zarrab who has pleaded not guilty prosecutors have now charged caglayan and former halkbank general manager suleyman aslan and two others according to the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york they were charged with  conspiring to use the us financial system to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of transactions on behalf of the government of iran and other iranian entities which were barred by united states sanctions  us prosecutors said in a statement dated wednesday they were also accused of lying to us government officials about the transactions laundering funds and defrauding several financial institutions by concealing the true nature of the transactions prosecutors said reuters was not immediately able to reach caglayan or aslan for comment halkbank said all of its transactions have always fully complied with national and international regulations adding that news

attempt the cleric fethullah gulen denies the allegation economy minister nihat zeybekci defended his predecessor and said us prosecutors had yet to prove their accusations  caglayan did not do anything against turkey s interests  zeybekci told reporters  it is no concern to turkey if caglayan acted against interests of other countries  both caglayan and aslan are also accused of taking bribes according to the indictment  caglayan who was serving as minister of the economy received tens of millions of dollars  worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services to the government of iran and conceal those services from us government officials  prosecutors said us prosecutors have said that between  and  zarrab and others worked to conceal his ability to supply currency and gold to iran through the turkish bank avoiding us sanctions as part of that scheme zarrab and others used front companies and fake invoices to trick us banks into processing transactions disguised to appear as though they involved food and thus were exempt from the sanctions prosecutors have said the us indictment echoes charges in a leaked  turkish police document reported by reuters which detailed allegations that a  crime organization  had helped iran exploit a loophole in western sanctions that allowed it to purchase gold with oil and gas revenues when the west prohibited the gold trade in  as a sanctions violation the police report alleged the network concocted records of shipments of food at preposterous volumes and prices to continue giving iran access to foreign currency iran emerged from years of economic isolation in january  when world powers lifted the crippling sanctions in return for tehran complying with a deal to curb its nuclear ambitions the sanctions had cut off the country of  million people from the global financial system slashed its exports and imposed severe economic hardship on iranians  caglayan aslan and others indicted in the case on wednesday remain at large prosecutors said  zarrab and a halkbank deputy general manager mehmet hakan atilla were arrested while in the united states zarrab was detained

       " 'white house pressures state department over refugee costs sources washington reuters  two studies that president donald trump hopes will buttress his case to cut the number of refugees are at the heart of a fight between senior white house adviser stephen miller and career us government officials over immigration policy four current and former officials said \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 trump in march ordered the us state department and other agencies to tally only the costs of resettling refugees but not the benefits that policy experts said refugees can also bring including tax revenues professional skills and job creation a current official said miller had convened meetings with state department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports when department specialists proposed including refugees’ economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment miller rebuffed the idea one current and one former us official said the white house said miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that trump’s overall fiscal year  budget proposal sought to “make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy” the current and former officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believe however that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis “it’s a policy outcome in search of a rationale” said a former us official familiar with the debate the white house disputed the notion that miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports which are to be compiled mainly by the state department’s bureau of population refugees and migration prm  “the idea that we are ordering biased reports is false” said michael short a white house spokesman the tensions over the reports due in september have not been previously reported miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration he  was the architect of trump’s order in january suspending the refugee program for  days and refugees from syria indefinitely that order which also temporarily barred travelers from seven muslimmajority countries was largely blocked by the courts as was a second executive order miller was not available for an interview rc hammond a senior adviser to secretary of state rex tillerson said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled miller “suggesting the state department review the methodology and findings of existing studies” on refugees “essentially suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn” hammond said in an email “my colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information” hammond he did not identify the state department staffer tensions in the government over trump’s immigration policies began with trump’s executive order which prompted about  state department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in january weeks later the rightwing breitbart website which has close ties to the white house published a story calling for the firing  among others  of the two top officials in the department of health and human services’ office of refugee resettlement and three senior officials at the prm bureau breitbart listed the officials by name but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs career officials cannot be fired but can be reassigned there is no evidence the five have been reassigned trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his  presidential campaign he called at one point for a complete ban on muslims entering the united states citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by islamist militants for the first report trump ordered a tally of “the estimated longterm costs of the united states refugee admissions program at the federal state and local levels along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs” trump directed that the second report estimate “how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum near their home countries for the same longterm cost as supporting refugees in the united states taking into account the full lifetime cost of federal state and local benefits and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere” refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in thirdcountry camps for a given sum than settled in the united states that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can most studies show that refugees entering the united states require more government services than immigrants as a whole but scholars differ over the longterm economic impact of accepting refugees which can depress lowskilled workers’ wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive during their first eight years in the united states refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes a study published this month by the nonprofit national bureau for economic research said “after the eighth year taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received” by an average of  over a year period the study found jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies which favors limiting immigration agreed that accountings such as those trump ordered should not be limited to costs  “it’s only fair to consider any fiscal benefits” she said the four current and former us officials said the highlevel white house focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome trump wants “when the white house calls and expresses interestin a report of this nature given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy” one of the former officials said ',\n",

       " 'trump moves to roll back obamaera financial regulations  the new york times president trump on friday moved to chisel away at the obama administration’s legacy on financial regulation announcing steps to revisit the rules enacted after the  financial crisis and to back away from a measure intended to protect consumers from bad investment advice after a white house meeting with executives from wall street mr trump signed a directive aimed at the   act crafted by the obama administration and passed by congress in response to the  meltdown he also signed a memorandum that paves the way for reversing a policy known as the fiduciary rule that requires brokers to act in a client’s best interest rather than seek the highest profits for themselves when providing retirement advice the executive order affecting   is vague in its wording and expansive in its reach it never mentions the law by name instead laying out “core principles” for regulations that include empowering american investors and enhancing the competitiveness of american companies even so it gives the treasury the authority to restructure major provisions of   and it directs the treasury secretary to make sure existing laws align with administration goals mr trump’s action on the fiduciary rule which democrats and consumer groups immediately denounced as a gift to wall street could have a more concrete impact his memorandum directs the labor department to review whether the rule may “adversely affect” investors’ ability to access financial advice  —   and if it does it authorizes the agency to rescind and revise the rule supporters of the rule describe it as a basic consumer protection to prevent brokers from taking advantage of vulnerable clients the industry argues that the rule will expose it to a torrent of lawsuits and will increase costs that firms will pass on to consumers taken together mr trump’s actions on friday constitute an extensive effort to loosen regulations on banks and other major financial companies even though the president campaigned as a champion of working americans and as a critic of wall street elites mr trump said on friday that his actions were intended to help both wall street and workers as his administration eases constraints on banks and allows them to lend more to companies which could then hire more workers “we expect to be cutting a lot out of   because frankly i have so many people friends of mine that had nice businesses they can’t borrow money” mr trump said in the state dining room during his meeting with business leaders “they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in   ” the  act reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading and curbed the ability of banks to trade with their own money in a measure known as the volcker rule despite the president’s concerns banks have increased their consumer lending like credit cards and auto loans and have generally expanded their lending to businesses as he announced his goals on financial deregulation mr trump sat beside stephen a schwarzman the chief executive of the private equity giant the blackstone group and the chairman of his business council who said the panel would “advise the government on the areas where we could do things a lot better in our country for all americans ” the president had praise for jamie dimon whose bank jpmorgan chase was often a target of regulatory actions by the obama administration “there’s nobody better to tell me about   than jamie so you’re going to tell me about it” mr trump said the meeting underscored the degree to which the architects of mr trump’s economic strategy are now some of the people he denounced in his campaign which ended with a commercial that described “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations ” the advertisement flashed an image of the chief executive of goldman sachs which has become a virtual feeder for top trump administration officials steven mnuchin his nominee for treasury secretary gary cohn the chairman of his national economic council and stephen k bannon mr trump’s chief strategist all had worked at goldman “the administration apparently plans to turn over financial regulation to wall street titan goldman sachs and make it easier for them and other big banks like wells fargo to steal from their customers and destabilize the economy” said lisa donner the executive director of americans for financial reform an advocacy group that supports   “that betrays the promises trump made to stand up to wall street ” the president’s actions came just hours after congressional republicans voted to repeal an unrelated   rule a sign that mr trump will have some support on capitol hill to challenge a law he has called “a disaster” and promised to do “a big number” to reshape now emboldened house republicans are also moving legislation to “repeal and replace”   though they would need  votes to accomplish that which seems unlikely and they are considering potential ways to use the budget process to defund some aspects of the law all of which comes on top of the president’s executive actions while the president cannot unwind   with the stroke of a pen his orders set the tone for the regulatory agencies enforcing the rules including the securities and exchange commission and the orders could portend even more executive actions that direct the regulators to halt financial regulation the president’s approach to regulation sharply contrasts with his predecessor president barack obama once remarked “i did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on wall street ” wall street is expected to lobby mr trump’s financial regulators at the s e c and elsewhere to modify rules and enforce them lightly but there is a limit to what the regulators can do   is still the law and it requires the regulators to enforce hundreds of   rules under administrative law the regulators must also formally propose any new rules and seek public comment the trump administration may have an easier time voiding the   labor department rule requiring brokers to act in a client’s best interest when providing retirement advice that rule is not explicitly part of   white house officials had considered a far more aggressive assault on the fiduciary rule which would have immediately halted it for six months or more while the labor department reviewed its effects the final memorandum appears to leave the regulation in place but it also goes a step further instructing the department to undertake what could be a lengthy new process for rewriting the rule if it is found to harm investors or financial companies “president trump’s action will make it harder for american savers to keep more of what they earn” senator sherrod brown the ranking democrat on the senate banking committee said in a statement but representative ann wagner republican of missouri called the effort to stop the fiduciary rule “a labor of love for me ” even before the president acted congressional republicans on friday started to chip away at   the republicans used an unusual parliamentary procedure to repeal a rule that stems from the law with only a majority of votes rather than the  votes needed to overcome a filibuster the senate voted  to  to void the rule which requires oil companies to publicly disclose payments made to governments when developing resources around the world the rule which   assigned to the s e c to enforce was tangential to the law’s mission of reforming wall street but lawmakers included it anyway with the hope of exposing bribes and corruption some of the largest american oil companies objected to the s e c rule including exxon mobil arguing that it put them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign companies rex w tillerson mr trump’s secretary of state personally lobbied against it when he was exxon’s top executive according to public accounts republicans are not done under the congressional review act of  congress has at least  days to introduce legislation repealing major new regulations already this week republicans introduced legislation under the act to repeal a consumer financial protection bureau rule for prepaid debit cards the congressional research service has determined that rules sent to congress on or after june  last year are vulnerable to repeal the s e c rule just missed that cutoff it became final on june  making it fair game for republicans to repeal over the objections of antipoverty groups like oxfam and the one campaign “if president trump is serious about his promise to ‘drain the swamp’ and protect american security he will veto this dangerous bill immediately” isabel munilla an oxfam official said in a

       " 'what happened in this election what happened in this election by john chuckman   john chuckman \\nbrushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy enlightenment and progressivity \\nthe election demonstrated perhaps better than ever and better than has been generally been recognized that america is indeed a plutocracy it took a genuine american oligarch a multibillionaire a man with a lifetime’s economic empirebuilding to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically wellconnected a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well everflowing with money for their ambitions \\nit was the everflowing well of money drilled by bill clinton with help from some extremely shady friends such as jeffrey epstein that made the clintons keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship—although bill in his heyday displayed some of both of those—that earned the clintons their place it was the money the “mother’s milk of politics” in what is euphemistically called “fund raising” many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill clinton’s efforts \\nhillary fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bill’s superficial charm but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm front when she was ready to move into running for office she adopted perhaps under bill’s tutelage a kind of forced clown face with arched eyebrows buggedout eyes and a smile as big as her lips would allow and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helterskelter whenever she campaigned \\nher gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a christmas parade or of the late harpo marx at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife both in a governor’s mansion and later in the white house bizarre because she indulged her husband’s nonstop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politicianhusband \\nanyway hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in american politics she determined to build a political war chest long ago and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view as when running for the senate when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of money embarrassingly large amounts \\nin her years of speaking engagements she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees later in the influential appointed post of secretary of state—coming as it does into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed bigtime international schemer—she unquestionably played an aggressive “pay for play” with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about \\na second big fact of the election is that both major american political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like “family values” public prayer and catering to the christian right and antiflag burning constitutional amendments and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party \\nhe was opposed by tired boring men like jeb bush seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency and a dark intensely unlikable phony christian fundamentalist like ted cruz and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political achievement but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party \\nthe republican party had been given a breather some new life by ronald reagan in the s he had an extremely mixed record as president but he was popular held in some affection and did have a clear vision but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another reagan but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the party and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment \\nthe republican party itself was formed not long before abraham lincoln’s candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors including the whigs and freesoil democrats parties do not last forever and here was trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party a phenomenon which i do not think was sufficiently noticed \\nthe press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the neocon wars hillary vigorously embraced and would expand \\nbut the democratic party is in serious trouble too it has a great deal of internal rot as the wikileaks material from the dnc clearly shows us arrogance lack of direction ignorance of the people it has always claimed to serve bad decisionmaking and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms \\nit would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to hillary clinton without serious rot she has always had strong negatives in polling always been rightly suspected concerning her honesty \\nthe wikileaks material tells us about many internal conflicts including harsh highlevel judgments of hillary’s decisionmaking resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter chelsea who is said to resemble hillary in her behavior and attitudes and the belief of some that hillary just should not have run and frankly she had become for many a rather tiresome usedup figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported her they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender bernie sanders \\nsanders might well have been able to win the election for the democrats but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy outofhand after all there were bill and hillary beckoning to their running well of money in hindsight it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the end giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the clintons since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward but in any event there he was out on the hustings supporting everything he ever opposed personified in hillary clinton men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive corporations a quality which i do think we have some right to expect trump to display \\nanother important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of trump than the avoidance of hillary that caused the defeat the numbers are unmistakable yes trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure but hillary simply did badly not approaching the support obama achieved in key states again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a wellliked figure and the party blundered badly in running her but again money talks and the clintons particularly bill are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime no one was ready to say no to the source of all that money \\nnow to many americans the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution although a revolution conducted through ballots any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive militarysecurity state in a way it does represent something of a revolutionary event owing to the fact that trump the oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views and as in any revolution even a small one there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes \\nthe historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come lyndon johnson lifelong crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless vietnam war did more for the rights of black americans than any other modern president franklin roosevelt son of wealthy establishment figures provided remarkable leadership in the great depression restoring hopes and dreams for millions change important change never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties it always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality \\ni have some limited but important hopes for trump i am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person and after the experience of obama who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing bloody disappointment i can never build up substantial hopes for any politician and what was the choice anyway hillary clinton was a boughtandpaid oneway ticket to hell \\ntrump offers two areas of some hope and these both represent real change the first is in reducing america’s close to outofcontrol military aggressiveness abroad this aggressiveness reflecting momentum from what can only be called the cheneyrumsfeld presidency continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of obama and was boosted and encouraged by hillary as secretary of state hillary the feminists who weep for her should be reminded did a lot of killing during her tenure she along with obama are literally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of women and their families many of them literally torn apart by bombs \\nthe other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary american people themselves who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades george bush’s lame reaction to hurricane katrina before he was internationally shamed into some action has become the normal pattern for america’s national government when it comes to ordinary americans \\nthe truth is that the legacy of fdr has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role in the democratic party and of course never did in the republican party by welfare i do not mean the kind of state assistance that bill clinton himself worked to end nothing can impress someone not familiar with america’s dark corners more than a visit to places like detroit or gary or chicago’s south side parts of new orleans or newark or dozens of other places where americans live in conditions in every way comparable to third world hellholes no i mean the people’s general wellbeing trump’s approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs i don’t know whether he can succeed but just as he asked people in some of his speeches “what do you have to lose” just having someone in power who pays any attention to the “deplorables” is a small gain \\npeople should never think of the clintons as liberal or progressive and that was just as much true for bill as it is for hillary his record as president—apart from his embarrassing behavior in the oval office with a young female intern and his recruitment of secret service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs—was actually pretty appalling he in his own words “ended welfare as we know it” he signed legislation which would send large numbers of young black men to prison he also signed legislation which contributed to the country’s later financial collapse under george bush he often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off leaving them dangling when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming his fbi conducted the assault on waco killing about eighty people needlessly a pharmaceutical plant in sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason there were a number of scandals including the suicide of vince foster and the socalled travelgate affair which were never fully explained to the public it was his secretary of state madeleine albright who answered unblinkingly a television interviewer’s question about tens of thousands of iraqi children who died owing to america’s embargo “we think it’s worth it” he committed the war crime of bombing belgrade when news of the horrors of the rwanda genocide were first detected by his government the order secretly went out to shut up about it no effort was made to intervene \\nno any real change in america could never come from people like the clintons either one of

       " 'modi’s cash ban brings pain but corruptionweary india grits its teeth  the new york times mumbai india  —   it was a bold and risky gamble by prime minister narendra modi of india that quickly seemed to backfire the announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in india which came into full effect at midnight friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country’s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy but despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least mr modi’s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena even as the poorest indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister’s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as “black money” flowing through the country’s economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption mr modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government “even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family i support what mr modi is doing for our country” said hem raj chechi  a taxi driver in new delhi the capital who said business had been down  percent since the ban was announced mr chechi has not been able to pay his children’s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months but he said “we need to fight black money even though it is hurting little people like me ” mr modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in new delhi bring jobs and fight corruption indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless declaring war on corruption mr modi announced on nov  that  and   rupee bills worth about  and  would be banned the next morning with the currency ban mr modi has managed to convince many disaffected indians that he is on their side he has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like mr chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good that frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many americans to vote for   donald j trump last year said eswar s prasad an economics professor at cornell university who is a native of india “trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system” mr prasad said in an interview “modi in the same way did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can’t tackle   problems like corruption we needed big and painful changes really disruptive ones ” mr modi appeared on television on new year’s eve to tell indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation he compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by mohandas k gandhi a battle of good versus evil “today mahatma gandhi is not among us but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate” mr modi said using the honorific for gandhi “as we begin the centenary year of the satyagraha” he said referring to gandhi’s nonviolent resistance movement “let us recall the mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness ” mr modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes which made up  percent of the money in circulation “it’s a little bit crazy” said geng xiao a professor of finance and public policy at the university of hong kong “when i first read the news i couldn’t even figure out if it was true ” the government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  —   more than   rupees or about   could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless whether mr modi’s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy but others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones and a country short of cash has been unable to spend it which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term economists say people living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard their diets and livelihoods severely affected many in india see mr modi who has also had success persuading parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines as living up to his promise to be a reformer of india’s ossified and bureaucratic economy but in the process he has placed the indian economy and his political future at risk many economists believe that the indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash and that the future impact is uncertain if the effects are prolonged the public support for modi could wane “if this move damages the economy he’s in for a rough ride” said harsh pant the head of strategic studies at the observer research foundation a new delhi think tank mr xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out “you need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing” he said mr modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in  defeating the government led by the indian national congress party that had ruled for most of the country’s   life on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption “in  he had presented himself as the big disrupter” mr pant said “he was the precursor to what’s happening in the west ” mr modi was then the chief minister of the state of gujarat where he had a reputation for tearing away the country’s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand but during his first two years after winning national election mr modi whose party did not control the upper house of parliament struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul mr modi changed the political narrative in  as he successfully fought to get parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax he cast the opposition as “people who don’t want change who don’t want reform” mr pant said forcing them in august to support the changes but the challenges facing mr modi remain considerable seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place the currency shortage remains acute leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings many providers said nagender tiwari  a rickshaw driver in east delhi said he was earning only  percent of the   rupees or about  that he used to take home daily before the cash ban as a result his family which includes two children in th grade has reduced its consumption of fish and meat they have been unable to pay the rent on their home he said he said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes “so if bribery is not stopped how can black money be stopped” he asked raj kumar bindal  a paper trader in new delhi said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before “we can’t shift to a cashless mode overnight” he said surjit bhalla a new   economic adviser for the observatory group in new york said he believed mr modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax india needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat mr bhalla said in the united states for every  collected in income tax an estimated  owed is not paid he added in india for that same  in taxes paid  more is owed he said collectively the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform india mr pant and others said but doing so depends on mr modi’s continuing to command the political narrative of the country as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban “so far he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him” mr pant said “he thinks he can continue to do it but we really don’t know there are so many unknowns ”',\n",

account of hillary clinton’s campaign chair john podesta the us justice department official peter kadzik in charge of of the probe into hillary clinton’s and huma abedin’s emails sent clinton campaign

the hearing would provide ‘additional chances for mischief’ \\nthey are last week’s scandal in a year running over with scandals but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal they are a

undermine the agreement the page draft resolution obtained by foreign policy is likely to be put to a vote by early next weekthe decision to take the deal to the security council before the us congress has concluded its own deliberations on the agreement places lawmakers in the uncomfortable position of potentially breaching a binding resolution by voting down the deal the strategy has infuriated some republican lawmakers who see the administration making an end run around congressduring a tuesday phone call to deputy secretary of state tony blinken house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce rcalif pressed him to put off a security council vote  i urged that the obama administration not seek action at the un security council on the agreement before congress can review it in detail during the legislatively mandated congressional review period  royce said in a statementcongress is currently weighing whether to accept or reject the deal brokered by the united states iran and five world powers under the terms of a us law passed this year lawmakers can prevent the president from lifting congressional sanctions on iran which would blow up the landmark nuclear dealhowever if a resolution is approved by the security council early next week any president democrat or republican would be legally bound to enforce its terms if congress were to veto the deal congress   the united states of america   would be in noncompliance with this agreement and contrary to all of the other countries in the world i don t think that s going to happen  us secretary of state john kerry told reporters tuesdaykerry suggested that the nuclear accord will likely win growing acceptance in washington if iran fully implements its obligations and is able to demonstrate  that they re not able or ready to make a bomb i am convinced that whoever is our next president will see the wisdom of this agreement and they will leave it in place  he addedon capitol hill there are currently two schools of thought about the wisdom of taking a resolution to the un security council prior to a vote in congressfor some republicans the move is a dangerous subjugation of us sovereignty and an insult to congress s oversight role given that huge bipartisan majorities in both houses voted for legislation to prevent the president from implementing the agreement before congressional review i think members from both sides of the aisle will see this tactic as an end run on congress  said jamil jaffer a republican and former chief counsel to the senate foreign relations committeeothers even those skeptical of a deal prefer that the un take action first so that congress can better understand the accord it s approving or rejecting it actually makes sense that we would go second because then we ll know what we re voting on  said a congressional aide who focuses on the iran nuclear portfolio  if we went first we d be in the uncomfortable position of approving something that could change depending on what s agreed on at the un indeed the united states and its negotiating partners have not included some of the most controversial provisions   for instance a decision to lift an embargo on conventional weaponry in five years and ease restrictions on the development and import of ballistic missile technology in eight years   in the nuclear accord that will be reviewed by congress instead those provisions are embedded in the new un security council resolution which congressional critics of the deal will have no power to blockthe new draft resolution provides weaker restrictions on iran s ballistic missile program than those contained in previous resolutions which banned iran from undertaking  any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons  the draft under consideration would only  call upon  iran not to engage in such activities it also includes no explicit prohibition on iran s development or import of conventional missile technology that means iran can continue to advance its conventional ballistic missile program without violating the terms set by the un security councilbut acquiring foreign supplies for its missile program will still be constrained by the deal a us administration official familiar with the deliberations noted that the draft requires that any company trying to supply iran with missilerelated technology seek approval from a committee composed of representatives from key powers including the united states the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said washington would use its position to  veto  the import of any sensitive missile technology into iran  the practical effect  of the new resolution is to preserve the same prohibitions contained in existing resolutions said the official  it prohibits effectively any transfer of missile technology conventional or nuclear according to an individual familiar with the talks the compromise on the arms embargo and ballistic missile sanctions came at the eleventh hour of negotiations in vienna iran backed by russia insisted that a final deal lift all restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles immediately seeking to break the impasse kerry  did some maneuvering between the iranians and russians and got it to a fiveeight compromise  meaning the conventionalarms embargo would be in effect for another five years and restrictions on ballistic missile technology would extend for eight years rather than lift immediately  this was a kerry special  said the individualprior to the conclusion of the nuclear talks republicans such as new hampshire sen kelly ayotte grilled obama administration officials about the dangers of lifting sanctions on iran that deter it from obtaining conventional weapons or ballistic missilesresponding to a question from ayotte last week gen martin dempsey the outgoing chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the senate armed services committee that  under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking when dempsey s remarks were raised during a press conference with obama on wednesday the president pushed back saying  we are not taking the pressure off iran with respect to arms and with respect to ballistic missiles instead the president asserted the new resolution would keep those restrictions in place while leaving washington with a  host of other multilateral and unilateral authorities that allow us to take action where we see iran engaged in those activities whether it s six years from now or  years from now  he saidvia fp',\n",

       " 'gene wilder dies at  star of ‘willy wonka’ and ‘young frankenstein’  the new york times gene wilder who established himself as one of america’s foremost comic actors with his delightfully neurotic performances in three films directed by mel brooks his eccentric star turn in the family classic “willy wonka and the chocolate factory” and his winning chemistry with richard pryor in the   smash “stir crazy” died early monday morning at his home in stamford conn he was  a nephew the filmmaker jordan   confirmed his death in a statement saying the cause was complications of alzheimer’s disease mr wilder’s rule for comedy was simple don’t try to make it funny try to make it real “i’m an actor not a clown” he said more than once with his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress he aspired to touch audiences much as charlie chaplin had the chaplin film “city lights” he said had “made the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny then sad then both at the same time ” mr wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred he directed he once said “in order to protect what i wrote which i wrote in order to act ” but he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders he made his movie debut in  in arthur penn’s celebrated crime drama “bonnie and clyde” in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by faye dunaway and warren beatty he was even more hysterical and even more memorable a year later in “the producers” the first film by mr brooks who later turned it into a broadway hit mr wilder played the    accountant leo bloom who discovers how to make more money on a bad broadway show than on a good one find rich backers stage a production that’s guaranteed to fold fast then flee the country with the leftover cash unhappily for bloom and his fellow schemer max bialystock played by zero mostel their outrageously tasteless musical “springtime for hitler” is a sensation the part earned mr wilder an academy award nomination for best supporting actor within a few years the anxious   popeyed mr wilder had become an unlikely movie star he was nominated for a golden globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in “willy wonka and the chocolate factory”  the film was a   disappointment partly because of parental concern that the moral of roald dahl’s story  —   that greedy gluttonous children should not go unpunished  —   was too dark in the telling but it went on to gain a devoted following and willy wonka remains one of the roles with which mr wilder is most closely identified his next role was more adult but equally strange an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named daisy in a segment of woody allen’s “everything you always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask” in  two years later he reunited with mr brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man’s filmography in “blazing saddles” a raunchy    spoof of hollywood westerns mr wilder had the relatively quiet role of the waco kid a boozy   who helps an improbable black sheriff cleavon little save a town from railroad barons and venal politicians the film’s   humor may have lost some of its edge over the years but mr wilder’s next brooks film “young frankenstein” has never grown old mr wilder himself hatched the idea envisioning a    film faithful to the look of the boris karloff “frankenstein” down to the laboratory equipment but played for laughs rather than for horror he would portray an american man of science the grandson of the infamous dr frankenstein who tries to turn his back on his heritage “that’s   ” but finds himself irresistibly drawn to transylvania to duplicate his grandfather’s creation of a monster in a spooky mountaintop laboratory mr brooks’s original reaction to the idea mr wilder recalled was noncommittal “cute that’s cute ” but he eventually came aboard as director and   and the two garnered an oscar nomination for their screenplay serendipity played a role in the casting mr wilder’s agent asked him to help find work for two new clients and thus marty feldman became frankenstein’s assistant igor “that’s  ” and peter boyle the monster madeline kahn whose performance as the chanteuse lili von shtupp had been a highlight of “blazing saddles” played the doctor’s socialite fiancée cloris leachman was frau blücher the sound of whose name caused horses to whinny in fear the name blücher mr wilder said in a  interview with the san jose mercury news came from a book of letters to and from sigmund freud “i saw someone named blücher had written to him and i said ‘well that’s the name ’” and mr wilder certainly knew a lot about freud his first of many visits to a psychotherapist is the opening scene in the memoir he published in  “kiss me like a stranger my search for love and art ” “what seems to be the trouble” the therapist asks “i want to give all my money away” he says “how much do you have” “i owe three hundred dollars ” soon the jokes and evasions give way to the torments of sexual repression guilt feelings and his “demon” a compulsion lasting several years to pray out loud to god at the most embarrassing times and in the most embarrassing places but never onstage or onscreen where he felt free to be someone else gene wilder was born jerome silberman in milwaukee on june   his father william a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items was an immigrant from russia his mother the former jeanne baer suffered from rheumatic heart disease and a temperament that sometimes led her to punish young jerry angrily and then smother him with regretful kisses he spent one semester at the   military institute in hollywood his mother saw it as a great opportunity in reality it was a catch basin for boys from broken families where he was regularly beaten up for being jewish safely back home after that misadventure he played minor roles in community theater productions and then followed his older sister corinne into the theater program at the university of iowa after iowa he studied shakespeare at the bristol old vic theater school in england where he was the first freshman to win the school fencing championship he next enrolled part time at the hb studio in new york while also serving a   army hitch as an aide in the psychiatric unit of the valley forge army hospital in pennsylvania  —   an assignment he requested because he said “i imagined the things i would see there might relate more to acting than any of the other choices ” he added “i wasn’t wrong ” after his discharge he won a coveted spot at the actors studio and it was then that he adopted the name gene wilder gene for eugene gant the protagonist of thomas wolfe’s “look homeward angel” and wilder for the playwright thornton wilder in his first major role on broadway mr wilder played the chaplain in a  production of bertolt brecht’s “mother courage and her children ” the production ran for less than two months and he came to believe that he had been miscast the good news was that he met the boyfriend of the star anne bancroft mel brooks who wore a pea coat the night he met mr wilder backstage and told him “you know they used to call these urine jackets but they didn’t sell ” so began the conversation that ultimately led to “the producers ” mr wilder’s association with mr brooks led in turn to one with richard pryor who was one of the writers of “blazing saddles” and mr brooks’s original choice for the part ultimately played by mr little in  mr pryor was   behind mr wilder and jill clayburgh in “silver streak” a comic thriller about murder on a transcontinental train the two men went on to star in the  hit “stir crazy” in which they played a hapless pair jailed for a crime they didn’t commit as well as “see no evil hear no evil”  and “another you”  mr wilder’s first two marriages to mary mercier and mary joan schutz ended in divorce in  he met the “saturday night live” comedian gilda radner when they were both cast in the suspense comedy “hanky panky ” one evening he recalled in “kiss me like a stranger” he and ms radner innocently ended up at his hotel to review some script changes the time came for her to go instead she shoved him down on the bed jumped on top of him and announced “i have a plan for fun” he sent her home anyway  —   she was married to another man  —   but before long they began a relationship by his account ms radner was needy obsessed with getting married and once they married in  obsessed with having a child a project that ended in miscarriage just months before she learned she had ovarian cancer in  of their first year of living together he wrote “we didn’t get along well and that’s a fact we just loved each other and that’s a fact ” he left only to find that he needed to go back ms radner died in  “i had one great blessing i was so dumb” mr wilder once said of her last years “i believed even three weeks before she died she would make it ” in memory of ms radner he helped to found an ovarian cancer detection center in her name in los angeles and gilda’s club a network of support centers for people with cancer he also contributed to a book “gilda’s disease”  with dr m steven piver mr wilder himself developed  ’s lymphoma in  with chemotherapy and a   transplant he was in remission by  in  mr wilder married karen boyer a hearing specialist who had coached him in the filming of “see no evil hear no evil” in which his character was deaf and mr pryor’s was blind she survives him as does a daughter from an earlier marriage his sister died in january even before he became ill mr wilder had begun slowing down he made his first and last attempt at a television series the   and   comedy “something wilder” in  he returned to the theater in  in a london production of neil simon’s “laughter on the rd floor ” in  he was a writer for two tv movies in which he starred “murder in a small town” and “the lady in question” playing a theater director turned amateur sleuth in  he appeared at the westport country playhouse in connecticut in a program of   farces shortly after appearing in an episode of “will  grace” in   —   he won an emmy for that role  —   he declared that he had retired from acting for good “i don’t like show business i realized” he said in  “i like show but i don’t like the business ” he was by then enjoying a new career as a novelist his “my french whore” published in  was the story of a naïve young american who impersonates a german spy in world war i “just fluff but sweet fluff” the novelist carolyn see wrote in her review in the washington post it was followed by two more novels “the woman who wouldn’t” and “something to remember you by” and a story collection “what is this thing called love” but it was of course as an actor that mr wilder left his most lasting mark in his memoir he posed a question about his life’s work then answered it “what do actors really want to be great actors yes but you can’t buy talent so it’s best to leave the word ‘great’ out of it i think to be believed onstage or onscreen is the one hope that all actors share ”',\n",

       " 'trump picks scott pruitt climate change denialist to lead epa  the new york times washington  —     donald j trump has selected scott pruitt the oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry to run the environmental protection agency signaling mr trump’s determination to dismantle president obama’s efforts to counter climate change  —   and much of the e p a itself mr pruitt a republican has been a key architect of the legal battle against mr obama’s climate change policies actions that fit with the  ’s comments during the campaign mr trump has criticized the established science of   global warming as a hoax vowed to “cancel” the paris accord committing nearly every nation to taking action to fight climate change and attacked mr obama’s signature global warming policy the clean power plan as a “war on coal ” mr pruitt has been in lock step with those views “scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind” he wrote in  national review earlier this year “that debate should be encouraged  —   in classrooms public forums and the halls of congress it should not be silenced with threats of prosecution dissent is not a crime ” a meeting on monday between the   and former vice president al gore may have given environmental activists a glimmer of hope that mr trump was moderating his campaign stance mr trump told new york times editors and reporters that he does “think there is some connectivity” between human activity and a warming planet with the choice of mr pruitt that hope will have faded “during the campaign mr trump regularly threatened to dismantle the e p a and roll back many of the gains made to reduce americans’ exposures to industrial pollution and with pruitt the   would make good on those threats” said ken cook head of the environmental working group a washington research and advocacy organization “it’s a safe assumption that pruitt could be the most hostile e p a administrator toward clean air and safe drinking water in history” he added mr pruitt  is a hero to conservative activists one of a group of republican attorneys general who formed an alliance with some of the nation’s top energy producers to push back against the obama regulatory agenda fossil fuel interests greeted mr trump’s selection with elation “attorney general scott pruitt has long been a defender of states’ rights and a vocal opponent of the current administration’s overreaching e p a ” said laura sheehan a spokeswoman for the american coalition for clean coal electricity which works on behalf of the coal industry “mr pruitt will be a significant voice of reason when it comes to energy and environmental regulations ” at the heart of mr obama’s efforts to tackle climate change are a collection of e p a regulations aimed at forcing power plants to significantly reduce their emissions of   carbon dioxide pollution mr trump cannot unilaterally cancel the rules which were released under the  clean air act but a legally experienced e p a chief could substantially weaken delay or slowly take them apart beyond climate change the e p a itself may be endangered mr trump campaigned on a pledge to greatly shrink  —   or even dismantle  —   it “we are going to get rid of it in almost every form” he once pledged mr pruitt may be the right man to do that as attorney general mr pruitt created a “federalism unit” in his office explicitly designed to fight president obama’s health care law and environmental regulations “you could see from him an increasing effort to delegate environmental regulations away from the federal government and towards the states” said ronald keith gaddie a professor of political science at the university of oklahoma although mr obama’s climate rules were not completed until  mr pruitt and a handful of other attorneys general began planning as early as  for a coordinated legal effort to fight them that resulted in a   lawsuit against the administration’s rules a decision on the case is pending in a federal court but it is widely expected to advance to the supreme court as mr pruitt has sought to use legal tools to fight environmental regulations on the oil and gas companies that are a major part of his state’s economy he has also worked with those companies a  investigation by the times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for mr pruitt to send on state stationery to the e p a the interior department the office of management and budget and even president obama outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules the close ties have paid off for mr pruitt politically harold g hamm the chief executive of continental energy an oklahoma oil and gas company was a   of mr pruitt’s    campaign mr pruitt who grew up in kentucky moved to oklahoma to go to law school an avid baseball fan for eight years he   and managed the oklahoma city redhawks a minor league team he won a seat in the oklahoma legislature and opened a small legal office which he called christian legal services to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights as he ran for attorney general of oklahoma in  he made clear that he intended to use his power as the state’s top law enforcement official to attempt to force the e p a to back down convinced that it was wrongly stepping on state government powers “there’s a mentality emanating from washington today that says ‘we know best’ it’s a     strategy a    kind of approach and we’ve got to make sure we know how to respond to that” mr pruitt was quoted as saying during his election campaign in  but that campaign once mr pruitt was sworn in quickly became an opportunity to work secretly with some of the largest oil and gas companies and the state’s   electric utility to try to overturn a large part of the obama administration’s regulations on air emissions water pollution and endangered animals documents obtained by the times show as attorney general mr pruitt took the unusual step of jointly filing an antiregulatory lawsuit with industry players such as oklahoma gas and electric the   electric utility and the domestic energy producers alliance a nonprofit group backed by major oil and gas executives including mr hamm behind the scenes he was taking campaign contributions from many of the industry players on his team or helping deliver even larger sums of money to the republican attorneys general association which he became the chairman of mr pruitt’s office also began to send letters to federal regulators  —   including the e p a and even president obama  —   that documents obtained through open records requests show were written by energy industry lobbyists from companies including devon energy mr pruitt’s staff put these ghostwritten letters on state government stationery and then sent them to washington moves that the companies often then praised in their own news releases without noting that they had actually drafted the letters in the first place mr pruitt understood that he was being painted as a tool of industry but in interviews and his own writing he rejected that analysis saying that he at times formed alliances with private sector players that shared his views  —   and was determined to help the energy industry and individual citizens in his home state “it is the job of the attorney general to defend the interests and   of the citizens and state of oklahoma” mr pruitt’s office said in a statement in  to the times “this includes protecting oklahoma’s economy from the perilous effects of federal overreach by agencies like the e p a the energy sector is a major driver of the oklahoma economy ” mr pruitt repeatedly explained that he thought states themselves were in the best position to regulate local industries be it oil and gas companies or other players that might affect the local environment such as devon energy which has been a contributor to his political causes and which he has helped push back against federal regulations with so much at stake mr pruitt’s confirmation hearings promise to be heated “at a time when climate change is the great environmental threat to the entire planet it is sad and dangerous that mr trump has nominated scott pruitt to lead the e p a ” said senator bernie sanders independent of vermont who sits on the committee that must confirm him “the american people must demand leaders who are willing to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels i will vigorously oppose this nomination ”',\n",
       " 'evidence that robots are winning the race for american jobs  the new york times who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans last year two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead but now they’ve declared a different winner the robots the industry most affected by automation is manufacturing for every robot per thousand workers up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as   of a percent according to a new paper by the economists daron acemoglu of m i t and pascual restrepo of boston university it appears to be the first study to quantify large direct negative effects of robots the paper is all the more significant because the researchers whose work is highly regarded in their field had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs in a paper last year they said it was likely that increased automation would create new better jobs so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers the theory goes new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts but that paper was a conceptual exercise the new one uses   data  —   and suggests a more pessimistic future the researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing that increase could still happen they said but for now there are large numbers of people out of work with no clear path forward  —   especially   men without college degrees “the conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover there will be losers in the process and it’s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover” mr acemoglu said “if you’ve worked in detroit for  years you don’t have the skills to go into health care” he said “the market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change ” the paper’s evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the treasury secretary steve mnuchin who said at an axios event last week that artificial intelligence’s displacement of human jobs was “not even on our radar screen” and “ to  more years” away not all robots use artificial intelligence but a panel of experts  —   polled by the m i t initiative on the digital economy in reaction to mr mnuchin’s comments  —   expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement the paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists why if machines are replacing human workers productivity hasn’t been increasing in manufacturing productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  —   and now we see evidence of it in the employment data too the study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the united states robots are to blame for up to   lost manufacturing jobs between  and  it concluded and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple the paper adds to the evidence that automation more than other factors like trade and offshoring that president trump campaigned on has been the bigger   threat to   jobs the researchers said the findings  —   “large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages”  —   remained strong even after controlling for imports offshoring software that displaces jobs worker demographics and the type of industry robots affected both men’s and women’s jobs the researchers found but the effect on male employment was up to twice as big the data doesn’t explain why but mr acemoglu had a guess women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a   field the economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly in an isolated area each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by   workers and wages by   percent but nationally the effects were smaller because jobs were created in other places take detroit home to automakers the biggest users of industrial robots employment was greatly affected if automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people employment might increase elsewhere in the country like at steel makers or taxi operators meanwhile the people in detroit will probably spend less at stores including these factors each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by   percent the findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones as it has in the past or eventually displace humans david autor a collaborator of mr acemoglu’s at m i t has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy “i don’t think that this paper is the last word on its subject but it’s an exceedingly carefully constructed and   first word” he said mr restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs like the rust belt “i still believe there will be jobs in the years to come though probably not as many as we have today” he said “but the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots ” in addition to cars industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics metal products plastics and chemicals they do not require humans to operate and do various tasks like welding painting and packaging from  to  the united states added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  —   mostly in the midwest south and east  —   and western europe added   the study a national bureau of economic research working paper published monday used data on the number of robots from the international federation of robotics there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use it analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones a way to measure local economies the next question is whether the coming wave of technologies  —   like machine learning drones and driverless cars  —   will have similar effects but on many more people',\n",

       " 'after orlando shooting talk show hosts suggest talk is not enough  the new york times talk show hosts talk after a mass murder the pattern goes they take a moment to talk more seriously they talk about grief love and hope and then  —   this being their job  —   they move on to talk about something else monday night as   shows aired their first episodes after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando fla there was a recurring theme talk is not enough anymore from more freewheeling cable shows to the mainstream broadcasters the prevailing message was that   hosts had been here so many times after so many mass murders the sad comic’s display of apolitical grief response had become shtick “you realize that you know what to say” stephen colbert said on cbs “because it’s been said too many times before ” samantha bee the host of “full frontal” on tbs said that she was too angry to deliver some “  words about how we will get through this together how love wins how love conquers hate ” she continued “love does not win unless we start loving each other enough to fix our expletive problems”  —   starting she argued with restricting access to guns like the semiautomatic that omar mateen used to kill dozens of clubgoers ms bee’s political comedy has been blistering from the second “full frontal” began in february and taking sides is her mission much as it was on her alma mater “the daily show ” in his own commentary on the terrorist attack trevor noah declared “america needs to make it a lot harder for people who shouldn’t have guns to get guns ” what was new was the quaver in ms bee’s voice  —   the barest suggestion that it was all she could do to keep it together even as she lashed the national rifle association and politicians who oppose gun regulations ms bee has been a   punk band of rage sarcasm and urgency monday’s show added an acoustic note of heartbreak ms bee’s   conan o’brien made a bigger departure never a particularly political host he told his audience “i have really tried very hard over the years not to bore you with what i think ” but on this night he said “i simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle ” hosts evolve over the years  —   david letterman became more political in his later seasons  —   and mr o’brien has been at this since  but he also now has the latitude afforded by a smaller cable audience it’s questionable whether were he still hosting “the tonight show” he would have been able to speak out the same way compare the emotional but conventional plea for peace and understanding offered by the current host of “the tonight show” jimmy fallon “maybe there’s a lesson from all this a lesson in tolerance we need to support each other’s differences and worry less about our own opinions ” on cbs’s “late show” mr colbert’s reaction captured his delicate effort over the past year to find a middle ground between the sharp point of view of “the colbert report” and the more typical neutrality of late night his monologue wasn’t as prescriptive as ms bee’s or mr o’brien’s but it tiptoed up to the edge of   …     something opening behind his desk  —   a departure for his show  —   mr colbert talked about love fighting despair but with the suggestion that feeling in itself wasn’t enough “love the families and the victims and the people of orlando but let’s remember that love is a verb and to love means to do something ” mr colbert was saying not that love is itself an action but that love requires acts to mean anything it was an idea that wouldn’t be out of place in a church group and indeed the former sunday school teacher seemed to be trying to bring that experience to late night not to punt on the moral question or preach about it but to think through a problem with his congregation he continued that approach with his first guest fox news’s bill o’reilly who had been scheduled before the attack the conservative host was more eager to talk about the   angle of the killings whereas it became clear that for mr colbert “do something” meant in part getting powerful guns off the streets conservatives will notice correctly that late night was not exactly an n r a  zone in his “a closer look” segment seth meyers touted a harvard study that linked more gun availability to more gun deaths “which should be obvious” mr meyers continued “that’s like saying where there’s more white people there’s more brunch ” but the “late show” exchange was strikingly civil mr o’reilly signaled openness to restrict some guns mr colbert gently shushed his less conservative audience when it grumbled at his guest “listen to what he has to say please ” trying to come to some mutual understanding about guns and terrorism at any time let alone in an election year seems quaint and quixotic and it symbolizes the tough job mr colbert has had in synthesizing the comedy central and cbs audiences on his new show he might be too political for the car   crowd too accommodating for partisans who want viral clips of their enemies being “totally destroyed ” whether he succeeds or not there was a growing exhausted sense monday that the usual     approach wasn’t cutting it as mr o’brien put it “it’s time to grow up ”',\n",

devastating  for pyongyang but said the use of force was not washington s first option to deal with the country s ballistic and nuclear weapons program  we are totally prepared for the second option not a preferred option  trump said at a white house news conference referring to military force  but if we take that option it will be devastating i can tell you that devastating for north korea that s called the military option if we have to take it we will  bellicose statements by trump and north korean leader kim jong un in recent weeks have created fears that a miscalculation could lead to action with untold ramifications particularly since pyongyang conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept  despite the increased tension the united states has not detected any change in north korea s military posture reflecting an increased threat the top us military officer said on tuesday the assessment by marine corps general joseph dunford chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff about pyongyang s military stance was in contrast to a south korean lawmaker who said pyongyang had boosted defenses on its east coast  while the political space is clearly very charged right now we haven t seen a change in the posture of north korean forces and we watch that very closely  dunford told a senate armed services committee hearing on his reappointment to his post in terms of a sense of urgency  north korea certainly poses the greatest threat today  dunford testified a us official speaking on the condition of anonymity said satellite imagery had detected a small number of north korean military aircraft moving to the north s east coast however the official said the activity did not change their assessment of pyongyang s military posture north korean foreign minister ri yong ho on monday accused trump of declaring war on the north and threatened that pyongyang would shoot down us warplanes flying near the korean peninsula after american bombers flew close to it last saturday ri was reacting to trump s twitter comments that kim and ri  won t be around much longer  if they acted on their threats toward the united states north korea has been working to develop nucleartipped missiles capable of hitting the us mainland which trump has said he will never allow dunford said pyongyang will have a nuclearcapable intercontinental ballistic missile  soon  and it was only a matter of a  very short time   we clearly have postured our forces to respond in the event of a provocation or a conflict  the general said adding that the united states has taken  all proper measures to protect our allies  including south korean and japan  it would be an incredibly provocative thing for them to conduct a nuclear test in the pacific as they have suggested and i think the north korean people would have to realize how serious that would be not only for the united states but for the international community  dunford said south korean lawmaker lee cheoluoo briefed by the country s spy agency said north korea was bolstering its defenses by moving aircraft to its east coast and taking other measures after the flight by us bombers lee said the united states appeared to have disclosed the flight route  intentionally because north korea seemed to be unaware us air force bb lancer bombers escorted by fighter jets flew east of north korea in a show of force after the heated exchange of rhetoric between trump and kim the united states has imposed sanctions on  people as part of its nonproliferation designations for north korea and nine banks including some with ties to china the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control sanctions said on tuesday the us sanctions target people in north korea and some north korean nationals in china russia libya and dubai according to a list posted on the agency s website us secretary of state rex tillerson will visit china from thursday to saturday for talks with senior officials that will include the crisis over north korea and trade the state department said on tuesday evans revere a former senior diplomat who met with a north korean delegation in switzerland this month said that pyongyang had been reaching out to  organizations and individuals  to encourage talks with former us officials to get a sense of the trump administration s thinking  they ve also been accepting invitations to attend dialogues hosted by others including the swiss and the russians  he said revere said his best guess for why the north koreans were doing this was because they were  puzzled by the unconventional way that president trump has been handling the north korea issue  and were eager to use  informal and unofficial meetings to gain a better understanding of what is motivating trump and his administration  during a visit to india us defense secretary jim mattis said diplomatic efforts continued speaking in beijing chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said war on the korean peninsula would have no winner  we hope the us and north korean politicians have sufficient political judgment to realize that resorting to military force will never be a viable way to resolve the peninsula issue and their own concerns  lu said south korean president moon jaein urged kim jong un to resume military talks and reunions of families split by the  korean war to ease tension  like i ve said multiple times before if north korea stops its reckless choices the table for talks and negotiations always remains open  moon said in moscow russia s foreign ministry said it was working behind the scenes to find a political solution and that it plans to hold talks with a representative of north korea s foreign ministry who is due to arrive in moscow on tuesday the ria news agency

campaign official said that mr trump would also speak to the church’s congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with ben carson a former presidential candidate and detroit native below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by the new york times  mr trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over case and point reverend pinckney in south carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their bible study and slaughtered the reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war what would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our country in the bible jesus said that a house divided cannot stand our best hope for erasing racial tensions in america is to work toward a   society in business we hire retain and award based on merit in society however we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country we have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul we have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws we have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the american workforce but perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all americans the higher the educational attainment the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder we must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of common core we must make sure that access affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system without a focus on educational outcomes for every american we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done we have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need this is not something one person can do but it is something that we can do together  mr trump there is a perception that your administration is racist with many of the african american voters their belief is that the republican party as a whole does not cater to african american needs in  and  we had two republican candidates john mccain and mitt romney and neither one of them came to detroit or any urban area that i can remember to even address the concerns of our community first i would like to commend you for coming to our community as a republican candidate second i need to know how would you change that perception in our community the proof as they say will be in the pudding coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in america we need to be true to our word and offer all americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential this means economic policies that will bring jobs back to america and will raise wages for all this means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children this means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer we need to get people off welfare and back to work we need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank get a loan and then start a business we need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government we need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties republicans have better options we just need to have the courage to present them with conviction  mr trump what is your vision for america and specifically black america if you repeal obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can’t afford it yet need it the most as president i must serve all americans without regard to race ethnicity or any other qualification i must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential if we are to make america great again we must reduce rather than highlight issues of race in this country i want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance every individual regardless of race or ethnicity must have access to the full array of opportunities in america my vision for america is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth as for the affordable care act i will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices every american should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines have health savings account that belong to them have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally we want to block grant medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people we want to make sure that every american has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it this approach will serve all americans and will ensure that more americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options  mr trump i am a registered democrat but i am an undecided voter in this election for  it is not only myself but there has been a lot of pastors and african americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for the latest polls indicate that you have  percent of the african american vote what can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the african american community that will win our vote on november   and beyond winning why is the african american vote important to you all votes are important to me and my campaign your vote your neighbor’s vote the vote of every american is critical and i must do all i can to make sure you know that if you vote for me you are voting for a stronger more vibrant america my policies offer you a clear choice you can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that unfortunately includes far too many people of color if you want a better america you must break from the historical hold that democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential this is all about opportunity  —   not   outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize the progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible education jobs religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that i will keep not just utter to gain favor if you are interested in a greater america with more

was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around trump to defeat the presumptive

personal campaign and mentioned him only once drawing boos and repeated chants of “we want trump” cuccinelli a former virginia attorney general said “when the speech ended there was an ugly crowd behind us” a witness said one person shouted “goldman sachs” at heidi cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank cruz began his speech saying “i want to congratulate donald trump on

to be mad if he didn’t say the words but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values he expected people to not be thrilled about this” the adviser said  trump won the party’s nomination on tuesday with  delegates followed by cruz with  delegates several delegates were outraged by the reaction to cruz’s speech saying it could undermine trump’s support among republicans who

released wednesday by quinnipiac university show trump leading clinton in florida and pennsylvania — and tied in the critical battleground state of ohio in three of the states that matter most in november the surveys point to a race much closer than the national polls which have clinton pegged to a significant midsingledigit advantage over trump suggest\\n\\nthe race is so close that its within the margin of error in each of the three states trump leads by three points in florida — the closest state in the  election —  percent to  percent in ohio the race is tied  percent to  percent and in pennsylvania — which hasnt voted for a republican presidential nominee since  — trump leads  percent to  percent\\n\\nclintons campaign responded to the surveys by cautioning that while the swing states were always expected to be close the urgent stakes of a possible trump election remain high\\n\\nwe know the battlegrounds are going to be close til the end thats why we need to keep working so hard clinton press secretary brian fallon tweeted wednesday morning trump is a serious danger folks\\n\\ntrump meanwhile thanked his supporters for the strong showing tweeting a celebratory series of images featuring fox news graphics showing the quinnipiac results thank you trump tweeted adding imwithyou an implicit shot at the clinton campaigns initial slogan im with her\\n\\nin another blow to clinton a mcclatchymarist poll of registered voters nationwide released on wednesday showed clintons lead over trump slip to three points  percent to  percent after leading by six points in a fox news poll conducted in late june\\n\\nbut other polls give clinton an advantage in all three states including the new quinnipiac surveys politico’s battleground state polling average — which include the five mostrecent polls in each state — gives clinton a point lead in florida a point edge in ohio and a larger point advantage in pennsylvania\\n\\nby wednesday afternoon a quartet of battleground polls painted a hazy picture of the race in those three states as well as in colorado and wisconsin the latest nbc newsmaristwall street journal polls showed clinton up by three points against trump in iowa  percent to  percent tied in ohio  percent to  percent and up by nine points in pennsylvania  percent to  percent in contrast to her twopoint deficit in the quinnipiac poll\\n\\nmonmouth universitys survey of likely colorado voters found clinton with a significant point advantage while trump cut into clintons wisconsin advantage by five points compared to last month trailing  percent to  percent compared to last month when clinton led  percent to  percent\\n\\nwhile the quinnipiac results are eyepopping they don’t represent any significant movement — except in florida in three rounds of polling over the past two months the race has moved from a fourpoint trump lead in ohio in the first survey then tied in the next two polls in pennsylvania clinton led by one point in the first two polls and now trails by two\\n\\nbut in florida the race has bounced around clinton led by one point in the first poll two months ago but she opened up an eightpoint lead in june — a lead that has been erased and more in the new quinnipiac survey\\n\\nthe polls from the connecticutbased school are likely to be met with some skepticism when quinnipiac released their first round of polls in the same three states two months ago they prompted a round of sniping from democrats and an fbomb on twitter from nate silver the fivethirtyeight founder who has built a career using poll results to make political predictions\\n\\nbut subsequent polls later confirmed the may quinnipiac surveys trump pulled virtually even with clinton nationally after knocking out his rivals for the gop nomination\\n\\nit’s possible the results of the fbi investigation into clinton’s private email server dating back to her service as secretary of state — fbi director james comey called clinton and her staff “extremely careless” even as he said the government shouldn’t press charges because there wasn’t evidence of criminal intent — are driving clinton’s poll numbers down leading into the conventions typically a critical time for campaigns\\n\\nin the poll release the school suggested the investigation could have played a role pointing to other lingering questions about clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness “while there is no definite link between clinton’s drop in florida and the us justice department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails” quinnipiac pollster peter brown said “she has lost ground to trump on questions which measure moral standards and honesty”\\n\\nbut the quinnipiac polls are imperfect measures of a postemail investigation race that’s because like many of the school’s other polls they were conducted over an unusually lengthy day time period june  through july \\n\\nthe national polls conducted since comey’s statement are mixed clinton posted a point lead in this week’s nbc newssurveymonkey online tracking poll down from a point lead the week prior morning consult another online tracking poll gave

candidate can break out of the low s on the ballot test that points to two very unpopular candidates\\n\\nbut in a reversal from earlier surveys it’s a more acute problem for clinton clinton’s unfavorable ratings  percent in florida  percent in ohio  percent in pennsylvania are higher than trump’s  percent in florida  percent in ohio  percent in pennsylvania in all three battleground states and majorities in all three states — which together account for  electoral votes or nearly a quarter of the  necessary to win the presidency — have a “very unfavorable” view of clinton\\n\\nanother measure of voters’ ambivalence about clinton in the quinnipiac poll a second ballottest question this time adding two thirdparty candidates to the mix when voters are asked to consider the general election again this time given the option of choosing libertarian candidate gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein trump’s advantage over clinton grows in each state trump leads on the fourway ballot by five points in florida one point in ohio and six points in pennsylvania\\n\\nthere are some eyebrowraising results from the polls however on the twoway ballot test in florida clinton trails trump despite the republican winning just  percent of nonwhite voters in the increasingly diverse state\\n\\nin ohio clinton wins  percent of democrats but trump only captures  percent of republicans putting him at a significant disadvantage in pennsylvania where democrats outnumber republicans by close to  percentage points both candidates are at  percent among their own partisans

the right choice for trumps vice president\\n\\nfor bernie sanders clintons dismal showing is more proof that his former rival needs to more effectively make her policybased case against trump\\n\\nthis is not a beauty contest between trump and hillary clinton sanders said on abcs good morning america this is the fact that the middle class of this country is in trouble which candidate has more to say about education more to say about health care more to say about climate change more to say about income and wealth inequality more to say about a sensible foreign policy and i think the more the people hear the contrast between the two i think secretary clintons support will grow\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'klimt’s women real and on canvas  the new york times among the most controversial issues roiling    vienna was “die frauenfrage” or “the woman question ” as they were doing in many other cities and nations of europe and north america women were challenging a patriarchal society that judged them unworthy of the rights customarily accorded to men you would hope that “klimt and the women of vienna’s golden age ” at the neue galerie would delve widely deeply and fearlessly into this complex topic but while scholarly essays in the hefty   catalog do just that the show itself only partly and obliquely brings out the most interesting issues relating to women and the art of gustav klimt that said the    portraits at the heart of the show are fascinating to look at and with help from the catalog to think about among them naturally is klimt’s best known painting “portrait of adele   i”  which sold for a record  million in  was made more famous last year by the movie “woman in gold” and has been on permanent display at the neue galerie since  and yet portraiture wasn’t klimt’s main thing he was primarily an allegorist who folded mythic figures into otherworldly visions of pagan religiosity during the period covered by this show he produced an average of only one portrait a year all of women and he hewed to a relatively standardized approach a compromise between tradition and modernism in his major portraits the subject’s head and features are rendered in a more or less conventionally realistic manner while the clothed body and background are painted more freely in styles reminiscent of impressionism symbolism and fauvism while the paintings represent chic modern women who belong to a world of elegance and luxury they also have the effect of exoticizing and etherealizing their subjects as the art historian jill lloyd observes in her catalog essay they seem both women of their time and timeless symbols of femininity at once contemporary and archaic ms lloyd avers that while klimt’s preoccupation with women in the full range of his art “may well relate to a personal obsession it also seems likely that klimt viewed the subject of women as a key to the modernity of his art ” his portraits she observes “embody allusions to ‘the women question’ that are far from straightforward to read ” in light of the ways women are represented in popular culture today these ideas are as relevant now as they were a century ago the exhibition which includes a selection of life drawings as well as numerous pieces of jewelry decorative objects and furniture designed by wiener werkstätte artists like josef hoffmann and koloman moser doesn’t go much into klimt’s personal life but the catalog does he was as ms lloyd puts it a “serial philanderer ” he never married but is believed to have fathered  children by his models and other   women but he also had a lifelong companion and confidante in the dress designer and business woman emilie flöge though whether they were lovers remains a mystery did klimt suffer from sigmund freud’s   complex perhaps in any event his portraits of actual women are certainly exalting unfortunately none of the explicitly erotic drawings he made of his models masturbating or of couples making love are included in the show for comparison with his more chaste portrait paintings here on a more pragmatic level klimt had a considerable investment in his few portraits because he depended on their subjects for his income in his catalog essay the exhibition’s organizer the klimt scholar tobias g natter explains that after a successful albeit controversial career under austrian state patronage klimt renounced governmental support and became the first president of the renegade vienna secession this posed a problem however because vienna lacked the independent dealer and gallery system that artists in paris and london could rely on instead of such a marketplace klimt depended on a small circle of wealthy private patrons “the more he sought out adventure and distanced himself from his state patrons the more indispensable the commitment of his private collectors and clients became” mr natter wrote klimt’s most important sponsor was szerena lederer the subject of one of the exhibition’s more beguiling portraits made in  it depicts its    subject in a gauzy glowing white dress against a pale beige background that contrasts sharply with her black hair and clearly defined facial features the effect is ghostly along with her industrialist husband august lederer szerena would eventually amass the largest collection of klimt’s work in private hands the lederer’s daughter elisabeth is the subject of another   portrait made in   the portrait shows her swathed in a white oddly elongated cocoonlike dress against a blue background decorated with cartoonish asian figures yet another member of the lederer clan szerena’s niece ria munk who committed suicide over a failed love affair at the age of  in  is the subject of a posthumous portrait called “the dancer”   she is shown in a richly floral patterned robe open to reveal her bare chest against a background of flowers and asian figures the painting that conveys a spirit of modern femininity best isn’t of a woman but of a    girl mäda primavesi made in  it depicts her in a white   dress standing on solidly planted feet with one arm akimbo gazing back at the viewer with a calm forthright expression she projects a   that girls often are blessed to own the painting could serve nicely as a poster for day of the girl which just happened on tuesday after world war ii primavesi emigrated to canada where she founded and headed a convalescent home for children in  she was in the news for selling a portrait by klimt of her mother eugenia primavesi that had been thought lost when mäda primavesi died in  a note in the catalog says “the last eyewitness to have personally experienced klimt at the easel passed ”',\n",

       " 'aleppo’s agony is far from over as syrian general seeks further battles by robert fisk on november   robert fisk — the independent nov   \\nthey’re keeping open the eight passages to western aleppo  just in case there have been no more air strikes on the surrounded east of the city by either syrian or russian jets – despite the antigovernment bombardment by jabhat alnusra and its largely islamist allies the syrian army has pushed its enemies nine miles further north of the city in which more than  civilians have been killed over the past six days and the militia offensive has predictably failed \\nnot that the united nations could be left out “shocked and appalled” it was of course and staffan de mistura the un envoy has churned out the old “war crimes” threat this time directed at the west’s friendly ‘moderates’ in eastern aleppo – whom he was keen to talk to a couple of weeks ago – rather than the bashar alassad regime but the un’s bleatings will make no difference nor will the john kerry’s oddly gaelic fears of aleppo smashed to “smithereens” – originally an irish word – have the slightest effect \\nyet the syrian government still hopes more civilians – militiamen too – will leave the besieged east and allow it to reabsorb the enclave without another war everything depends right now on three people the commander of the syrian aleppo garrison the head of the baath party in the city and the boss – whoever he is – of the jabhat alnusra militia and their ahrar alsham allies and other outfits who are defending or imprisoning delete as appropriate as usual the  to  civilians in eastern aleppo \\nso we’ll start with the bespectacled general in charge of the evacuation whose office i found adorned with vast operational maps of aleppo – in which the east of the city appears as a grey bent sausage with a circle to the left the ancient citadel still held by syrian troops pierced by eight large red arrows whether the arrows represent planned attacks or the crossing points which the government opened on  october from am to pm each day – with only  takers so far – was unclear but the four large banners hanging from flagstaffs behind the general’s desk told their own story hezbollah’s green and yellow the red white and blue of russia the black white and red of syria and the green white and red of iran \\na multicoloured coalition then with a lot of firepower – and an intriguing set of military video clips of the crossings as they opened on  october each shows a syrian armoured vehicle with a loudspeaker calling on “the people of aleppo” to “take out the wounded and civilians from the east of aleppo along the routes that have been planned by the government” adding revealingly that “the syrian government in cooperation with the russian forces will guarantee safety for you and your family” russian officers were indeed at the crossing points on the three first days two of them were wounded by snipers one of the video clips shows a shell apparently fired from eastern aleppo exploding in the background as two men run from the east to the syrian army lines \\nthe general thought there were only  civilians left in eastern aleppo an intriguing figure since the number of trapped families in the enclave have moved between  and  according to various “experts” the un believes the higher figure a syrian army officer on the front line suggested  another far more senior syrian intelligence officer thought  the ba’ath party guessed between  to  all of which proves that no one – neither the un the syrians or journalists – has the slightest idea of just how many souls are waiting to be saved or to die \\n“we promised to take care of the injured” the general announced “we did the people who came across were free to go and live with their relatives in the west of the city or to apartments which we had reserved for them they chose their relatives” then he added almost without hesitation “now the decision is that we must enter the battle and put an end to the nusra and other terrorist groups to help the people themselves to get rid of them” \\ndid this mean that the halt in russian and syrian bombing of eastern aleppo would resume a telephone rang on the general’s desk and a flurry of staff officers ran into his office with aerial photographs – presumably the work of a drone – and his attention suddenly turned to more pressing matters “there are armed men crossing from turkey through the bab alhowa border point to the north of lattakia” – which showed just how far the general’s remit ran in northern syria – “and they are driving a lot of vehicles with explosives and ammunition look we search for a political solution and they are ready to attack and fight” \\nbut would the syrians and russians bomb east aleppo again “there are orders that the planes cannot bomb within km of eastern aleppo” the general replied an interesting remark since the general is the man who orders the air strikes – along with his russian colleagues of course – and he followed up with a slightly ambiguous remark when i asked for his feelings when he saw the wounded children of east aleppo on television “i see them as like my kids” he replied “i have a very high sense of humanity with civilians but with terrorists i have to do my national duty – to defend the civilians and protect them the terrorists” – and the general thought there were  separate armed groups in eastern aleppo – “are the same wherever they exist – in syria iran britain russia lebanon…” \\nperhaps but the general also made a remark about “medical facilities for terrorists” which suggested that hospitals who treated militiamen in east aleppo were targets for the syrianrussian coalition whomever else the hospitals treated which also tells its own grim tale so now to the baath headquarters in aleppo bathed in generator light and sudden power cuts where the local party head ahmed ibrahim saleh described how he talked to east aleppo civilians by phone claiming that – through these interlocutors – he has contact with  civilians in the enclave \\nand negotiations were continuing he said the ahrar alsham group had indirectly received a message from the government via text and they replied by recorded phone calls the government’s message was that they could send over a group of their men if they wanted to cross to the west of the city as a test – just two if they wanted – and these two could telephone when they arrived through the government lines and reached a safe place \\n“they said ‘we trust you but we don’t trust the syrian government or the state security apparatus’ i said ‘just find four or five armed men to cross’ they said they would discuss this the problem is that the leaders of these armed groups the foreigners make them afraid and tell them that the security apparatus will execute them but all the armed men who have come to this building have been welltreated” this appears to be perfectly true but the constant reference to the ‘security apparatus’ was telling everyone in syria fears the mukhabarat security police \\nwhen i asked mr saleh about hospitals in the east of the city i heard a familiar story “this is war maybe there are some mistakes maybe the plane cannot see women and children one hospital shelled by a plane was a base for the leaders of the terrorists and was full of arms and weapons” this was quite an admission when nato found soldiers hiding in a hospital during the  war on serbia its bombs killed all the civilians in the building but none of the soldiers no one spoke of war criminals a different morality is in play in syria of course where the bombing of hospitals is immediately – and legally correctly – referred to as a war crime \\nas for the conflict “war ends when foreign support stops” mr saleh said “if america says ‘stop the war’ the war will stop” so now to a young syrian army captain on the front line who guards one of the crossing points during the truce he received two armed men who had contacted him earlier to arrange the crossing “they came right here to my office” he said “one of them was from ahrar alsham we let them come with their guns we had vehicles ready for them with covered windows so that no one could shoot at them i told them which road to use to come out they were checked by our people in case they carried booby traps we could see them but the two men could not see our soldiers \\n“they told me that their life stopped when the war began and did not advance any more in the following years one of the men said his dream was ‘just one more night of sleep and one more day of life for me and my family’ the two men knew each other and they complained that the armed groups were uneducated and illiterate yes when we shell east aleppo we are defending ourselves – just as they will defend their side of the city when we rocket them how many people are there i myself think the un’s figures might be exaggerated when the passages were opened eight wounded men from ahrar alsham came out and we offered them health care and they refused and said they wanted to join the other terrorists in idlib province because they were wounded they were friendly to the army i met the eight of them we allowed them freely to go to idlib” \\nand this is also true the armed men who surrendered in homs were allowed to go to idlib so were the armed opposition in the damascus suburbs including those of mouadamiya idlib seems to be the favourite dumping ground for all varieties of islamist fighters for the syrian government the armed men of aleppo should either agree to go home or head for idlib themselves along with their families but will they the captain had heard of  executions by ahrar alsham of armed men who wished to leave eastern aleppo propaganda maybe but the commanders of the islamist groups there give no interviews to visiting western reporters – because western journalists have wisely decided not to turn up in east aleppo and have their heads cut off \\nso was the recent offensive against western aleppo the answer to the syrians’ “passageways” to freedom to the “corridors” of safety which were opened for the civilians perhaps but given the amount of weaponry the militias deployed in recent days they may have decided that they still have no need to negotiate another truce or take the bus to idlib then we are left with the general’s remark about how “the decision is to enter the battle” in other words aleppo’s agony is far from over',\n",
       " 'confusion over trumps first talks with foreign leader washington reuters  one day before us presidentelect donald trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader japanese prime minister shinzo abe japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in new york it would take place who would be invited or in some cases whom to call for answers uncertainty over the talks shows the difficulties in turning trump from a freewheeling businessman into a sitting president with a watertight schedule and a fully functioning administration by his inauguration on jan                japanese and us officials said on wednesday the state department had not been involved in planning the meeting leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined “there has been a lot of confusion” said one japanese official  the meeting was only agreed to last week and trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in manhattan’s trump tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration  while world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold highlevel diplomatic talks in the united states without detailed planning abe is on his way to an asiapacific summit in peru state department spokesman john kirby said that to his knowledge trump’s transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders trump is expected to use the abe meeting to reassure japan and other asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric advisers to trump said  but trump a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience and abe a veteran lawmaker have differences on policy issues such as free trade     several trump aides did not immediately answer requests on wednesday for comment about the abe visit or contact between the transition team and the state department    speculation about top appointments to the trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition new jersey governor chris christie was removed last week and replaced by vice presidentelect mike pence transition team officials said on wednesday night that trump planned to announce “landing teams” on thursday that would begin setting up staff in key agencies like the state and justice departments they added in a conference call with reporters that those who begin working on the teams would have to sign an agreement not to lobby for five years after they leave the administration keeping with a trump campaign promise to institute a ban on lobbying for executive branch employees  trump on wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team singling out the new york times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him since his upset victory over democrat hillary clinton in the nov  presidential election     the republican real estate magnate said on twitter he had taken “calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing nytimes said russia uk china saudi arabia japan”  the times a frequent target of trump’s twitter blasts said on tuesday that us allies were “scrambling to figure out how and when to contact mr trump” and blindly dialing in to trump tower to try to reach him the newspaper said trump was working without official state department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders         “the failing nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition” trump tweeted without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect “it is going so smoothly also i have spoken to many foreign leaders”     trump and pence had spoken to  foreign leaders the transition team said on wednesday trump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a us presidentelect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory but some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure      egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi an army general who seized power three years ago appears to have been the first leader to speak to trump after the election ahead of closer allies like the leaders of britain and germany sisi’s office called trump last wednesday and the incoming us president told him it was “the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election”  australian media reported that prime minister malcolm turnbull was the second leader trump spoke to after the australian ambassador to the united states got trump’s personal phone number from australian golfer and trump friend greg norman  trump also talked on the phone to the leaders of britain germany turkey and other allies   but a phone call on monday with russian president vladimir putin in which the two men agreed to aim for “constructive cooperation” raised eyebrows among democrats and traditionalist republicans worried about a resurgent moscow trump also met britain’s antieu brexit campaigner nigel farage at trump tower last weekend ahead of any meeting with british prime minister theresa may state department spokesman kirby said “there’s been no outreach to date” from trump’s transition aides “but it’s not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the presidentelect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders” despite fevered speculation trump has yet to say who will fill cabinet positions such as secretary of state treasury secretary or defense secretary his team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of democrat barack obama to the white house after he won the presidency in   trump could add soninlaw jared kushner as a top white house adviser the wall street journal reported on wednesday kushner who is married to ivanka trump has been a central adviser during the campaign and transition the trump transition team has repeatedly denied it is seeking highlevel security clearance for kushner a federal antinepotism law prohibits a

       " 'trump’s tough trade talk could damage american factories  the new york times holland mich  —   while much of the american political class has been consumed with recriminations over the wrenching loss of manufacturing jobs chuck reid has been quietly adding them his company first class seating makes recliner seats for movie theaters here at a factory on the shores of lake michigan since he bought the business three years ago its work force has grown to  from  but those jobs will be in jeopardy if   donald j trump follows through on his combative promises to punish countries he deems guilty of unfair trade mr trump secured the white house in part by vowing to bring manufacturing jobs back to american shores the   has fixed on china as a symbol of nefarious trade practices while threatening to slap  percent punitive tariffs on chinese imports but many existing american manufacturing jobs depend heavily on access to a broad array of goods drawn from a global supply chain  —   fabrics chemicals electronics and other parts many of them come from china at mr reid’s factory imports account for roughly   of the cost of making a recliner chair in short mr trump’s signature trade promise one ostensibly aimed at protecting american jobs may well deliver the reverse it risks making successful american manufacturers more vulnerable by raising their costs it would unleash havoc on the global supply chain prompting some multinationals to leave the united states and shift manufacturing to countries where they can be assured of buying components at the lowest prices “if you do this tomorrow you would have a lot of disruption” said susan helper an economist at the weatherhead school of management at case western reserve university in cleveland “the stuff that china now makes and the way they make it it’s not trivial to replicate that ” mr reid takes pride in using american products his designers here in michigan dreamed up his sleek recliner local hands construct the frames using   steel then affix molded foam from a factory in nearby grand rapids they staple upholstery to hunks of wood harvested by timber operations in wisconsin they do all this inside a former heating and cooling equipment factory that shut down a decade ago when the work shifted to mexico but the fabric for mr reid’s seats arrives from china so do the electronics in the “magic box” that enables moviegoers to control the recliner ditto the plastic cup holders and the bolts and screws that hold the parts together the motor is the work of a german company that makes it in hungary almost certainly using electronics from china mr reid estimates that a  percent tariff on chinese wares would raise the costs of making a recliner here by  percent tariffs would give his factory an edge against american competitors that import even more from china but his company would be vulnerable to competitors in mexico colombia and australia they would be free to draw on china’s supply chain and sell their wares into the american market unhindered “our chair would be priced out of the market” mr reid said “if it impacts our sales that puts jobs at risk ” trade experts dismiss mr trump’s threat of tariffs as campaign bluster that will soon give way to pragmatic concerns about growth and employment between  and  the imported share of components folded into american manufacturing rose to  percent from  percent according to one widely cited study international law also limits the scope of what the trump administration can do under the rules of the world trade organization the united states cannot   apply tariffs it must develop cases industry by industry proving that china is damaging american rivals through unfair practices talk of    tariffs is “pure theater” said marc l busch an expert on international trade policy at georgetown university in washington “it’s impossible to do it violates the rule of law ” but mr trump has suggested taking the extraordinary step of abandoning the w t o to gain authority to dictate terms his successful   of carrier the   company which agreed to keep   jobs at a plant in indiana rather than move them to mexico attests to his priorities in delivering on his trade promises the people advising mr trump on trade have records of advocating a pugnacious response to what they portray as chinese predations there is dan dimicco the former chief executive of the american steel giant nucor who has long advocated punitive tariffs on chinese goods there is peter navarro a senior policy adviser and   of a book titled “death by china confronting the dragon  —   a global call to action ” in an email on friday mr navarro the trump transition team’s economic adviser said that imposing steep tariffs on china was an essential step to begin to address the american trade deficit with china which reached  billion last year he blamed chinese trade practices for “destroying entire industries hollowing out entire communities” and “putting millions out of work ” but mr navarro also cast the threat of tariffs as an opening gambit in a refashioning of trade positions “tariffs are not an end game but merely one of several negotiating tools to bring our trade back into balance” he said adding that mr trump’s administration would do so “in a measured way ” mr navarro’s   greg autry a professor at the university of southern california said he assumed the trump camp was dead serious about its threats to impose tariffs on china the goal is to force manufacturers to come back to the united states as a condition of selling into the american market a   trade war between the world’s two largest economies would cost american jobs in the immediate term mr autry said but eventually millions of new ones would be created as the united states again hummed with factory work “we moved our supply chain to asia in about two decades” he said “you certainly can do it in the u s a whole lot faster it’s going to take a few years but it’s going to be a much better america ” even if factory work does return to the united states though that is unlikely to translate into many paychecks as automation spreads robots are primed to secure most of the jobs at mr reid’s factory talk of a bountiful future through trade barriers resonates as dangerous nonsense mr reid has a business to run in the here and now his customers are waiting for product he must be able to tap the supply chain “you can’t just turn your ship around and bring that stuff back” he said in threatening tariffs mr trump is wielding a blunt instrument whose impacts are increasingly easy to evade by sophisticated businesses with operations across multiple borders the geography of global trade is perpetually being redrawn in china factory owners casting a wary eye on mr trump are accelerating their exploration of alternative locales with   workers across southeast asia and even as far away as africa in vietnam entrepreneurs are preparing for a potential surge of incoming investment from china should mr trump take action in europe factories that sell manufacturing equipment to china are watching to see if mr trump will unleash trade hostilities that will damage global growth “money and goods will always find their way regardless of what barriers you put up” said ernesto maurer chairman of ssm a swiss maker of textile machinery that operates a factory in china “you just make it more difficult and more expensive ” in the southern chinese city of guangzhou jiang jiacheng exudes confidence that china will continue to serve as the factory floor for the world  —   with tariffs or otherwise his company the guangzhou shuqee digital tech company makes movie chairs exporting about  percent of its wares to the united states it is an exemplar both of china’s manufacturing prowess and of the conditions that make it a competitive threat mr jiang pays his factory workers  a month they work six days a week lax environmental rules allow him to dispose of pollutants cheaply the total cost of making one of his   products a   movie chair runs  he sells it for  to wholesalers who export to the united states back in september mr jiang gathered with other chinese movie chair manufacturers to discuss the alarming statements coming from mr trump the consensus view was not to worry “once he takes up the post he will certainly return things to the normal state” mr jiang said still he has a backup plan even before president trump entered the lexicon mr jiang was exploring a transfer of some of his work to   places like vietnam his company would not be the first to make the journey a dozen years ago the united states commerce department accused china of dumping wooden bedroom furniture at below cost it imposed protective tariffs for lawrence m d yen who had a furniture factory in southern china that was the impetus to move to vietnam labor costs were cheaper today mr yen’s company woodworth wooden industries operates a factory in cu chi on the outskirts of ho chi minh city a district best known for the elaborate tunnels used by vietcong guerrillas in their battles against american forces this former hive of combat is now the workplace for   people making sofa beds recliner chairs and bedroom furniture   of the products are destined for the united states including las vegas casino resorts like mandalay bay and the mgm grand woodworth’s plant churns out more than     sofas each month this year the company opened a second vietnam factory arithmetic gives mr yen confidence that mr trump’s talk will be muted by the realities of the marketplace brands that deliver   goods to american retailers have leaned heavily on asian suppliers to secure low prices in pledging to bring manufacturing back mr trump is effectively pitting the interests of a relatively small group of people  —   those who work in factories  —   against hundreds of millions of consumers “the retail industry now employs an awful lot more people than apparel industries ever did” said pietra rivoli a trade expert at georgetown seven years ago the obama administration accused china of unfairly subsidizing tires it imposed tariffs reaching  percent a subsequent analysis by the peterson institute for international economics a nonpartisan think tank calculated the effect some   american   jobs were preserved but american consumers paid   billion extra for tires that prompted households to cut spending at retailers resulting in more than   net jobs lost the tal group claims to make one of every six dress shirts sold in the united states it produces finished goods for brooks brothers banana republic and j crew operating  factories worldwide if mr trump places tariffs on china the company will accelerate its shift to vietnam said tal’s chief executive roger lee if that trade is disrupted the work would flow to other   countries like bangladesh india and indonesia mr lee can envision no situation in which the physically taxing monotonous work of making garments will go to the united states “where are you going to find the work force in the u s that is willing to work at factories” mr lee said horgen a swiss village on the shores of lake zurich seems far removed from the gritty industrial zones of asia with its gingerbread homes and mountain views it looks more like a resort but horgen is home to ssm a company that has become an important supplier to asia its machines turn polyester and other synthetic fibers into   threads if the rise of textiles in asia has been a gold rush this swiss company has been among those cashing in by making the picks and shovels workers at the factory earn roughly   swiss francs   a month  —   some  times what ssm pays its workers at its chinese factory it makes its most sophisticated components in switzerland and at another plant in italy it uses china for   machines the company sells virtually all of its products abroad chiefly in asia it buys metal parts from the czech republic and poland electronic components from malaysia and electric motors from an american company that makes them at a factory in india another american company supplies software “there is not a single machine that we have that we are able to build with materials from one country” said mr maurer the ssm chairman if the united states were to impose trade barriers on china that might slow chinese demand for   textile machinery that would potentially reduce swiss purchases of american goods and services but mr maurer struggles to see how this would create any jobs in the united states the american textile industry is small and increasingly dominated by robots the rest of the world holds billions of hands willing to work cheaply “someone else will pick up the business” mr maurer said “these markets are very fast ” but the textile and apparel trades are relatively simple businesses if the cost of making trousers becomes less appealing in china a room full of sewing machines in cambodia can quickly be filled with   seamstresses industries involving precision machinery are not so easily reassembled somewhere else an abrupt change to the economics would devastate factories that could not quickly line up alternative suppliers american automakers are especially dependent on the global supply chain between  and  the percentage of imported components that went into exported   vehicles grew to  percent from  percent according to the organization for economic cooperation and development at ebw electronics in holland mich workers in lab coats tend boxy soldering machines as they make circuitry for led lights that go into cars it buys tiny parts and slots them into circuit boards which are sold to major automakers some  percent of the components are imported from china even that number fails to capture the degree to which the company  —   and its  workers  —   depend on unfettered trade pat leblanc the chairman pointed to a nib of metal on a circuit board the silicon was extracted at a plant in minnesota then processed into a thin wafer at another factory in massachusetts the wafer was shipped to china for testing cut into pieces at another chinese factory and then delivered to the philippines for a chemical process then it went back to china to be put onto a reel that can be inserted into soldering machines here in michigan “it literally is a global supply chain” mr leblanc said mr reid the owner of the theater seating company could not imagine having to buy everything from american suppliers buying upholstery domestically would raise his fabric costs as much as  percent “all the componentry all the cords it all comes from china” he said “i don’t know that you could ever get all of that made in

rallies and on twitter has come from a pair of groups that spent less than  million combined mr trump’s   for may reflects his lag in assembling the core of a national finance team in the same month that he clinched the republican nomination mr trump raised just   million and was forced to lend himself  million to meet costs some invitations to trump   events have featured the same short list of

significant shortfalls of money and manpower on monday the party reported raising  million during may about a third of the money it raised in may  when mitt romney led the ticket “it’s like a waterfall” said brian o walsh a republican campaign strategist “there are things that have to happen and someone has to pay for them ” mr trump’s cash crunch marks a stark reversal from the

as national finance   of the romney campaign “and it better be a big old cadillac ” mr trump has defied conventional wisdom before clinching the republican nomination with a small organization and

much information that it’s difficult to see the large mosaic created by the tiny parts \\nupdated today julian assange made a statement about the election  in recent months wikileaks and i personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the clinton campaign says about itself to itself that pressure has come from the campaign’s allies including the obama administration and from liberals who are anxious about who will be elected us president on the eve of the election it is important to restate why we have published what we have the right to receive and impart true information is the guiding principle of wikileaks – an organization that has a staff and organizational mission far beyond myself our organization defends the public’s right to be informed this is why irrespective of the outcome of the  us presidential election the real victor is the us public which is better informed as a result of our work the us public has thoroughly engaged with wikileaks’ election related publications which number more than one hundred thousand documents millions of americans have poured over the leaks and passed on their citations to each other and to us it is an open model of journalism that gatekeepers are uncomfortable with but which is perfectly harmonious with the first amendment we publish material given to us if it is of political diplomatic historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere when we have material that fulfills this criteria  we publish we had information that fit our editorial criteria which related to the sanders and clinton campaign dnc leaks and the clinton political campaign and foundation podesta emails noone disputes the public importance of these publications it would be unconscionable for wikileaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election at the same time we cannot publish what we do not have to date we have not received information on donald trump’s campaign or jill stein’s campaign or gary johnson’s campaign or any of the other candidates that fufills our stated editorial criteria as a result of publishing clinton’s cables and indexing her emails we are seen as domain experts on clinton archives so it is natural that clinton sources come to us we publish as fast as our resources will allow and as fast as the public can absorb it that is our commitment to ourselves to our sources and to the public this is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election the democratic and republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers i spoke at the launch of the campaign for jill stein the green party candidate because her platform addresses the need to protect them this is an issue that is close to my heart because of the obama administration’s inhuman and degrading treatment of one of our alleged sources chelsea manning but wikileaks publications are not an attempt to get jill stein elected or to take revenge over ms manning’s treatment either publishing is what we do to withhold the publication of such information until after the election would have been to favour one of the candidates above the public’s right to know this is after all what happened when the new york times withheld evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the us population for a year until after the  election denying the public a critical understanding of the incumbent president george w bush which probably secured his reelection the current editor of the new york times has distanced himself from that decision and rightly so the us public defends free speech more passionately but the first amendment only truly lives through its repeated exercise the first amendment explicitly prevents the executive from attempting to restrict anyone’s ability to speak and publish freely the first amendment does not privilege old media with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions over wikileaks’ model of scientific journalism or an individual’s decision to inform their friends on social media the first amendment unapologetically nurtures the democratization of knowledge with the internet it has reached its full potential yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clinton’s main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications—because none exists in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them – a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate wikileaks’ decadelong pristine record for authentication remains our key publications this round have even been proven through the cryptographic signatures of the companies they passed through such as google it is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them we have endured intense criticism primarily from clinton supporters for our publications many longterm supporters have been frustrated because we have not addressed this criticism in a systematic way or responded to a number of false narratives about wikileaks’ motivation or sources ultimately however if wl reacted to every false claim we would have to divert resources from our primary work wikileaks like all publishers is ultimately accountable to its funders those funders are you our resources are entirely made up of contributions from the public and our book sales this allows us to be principled independent and free in a way no other influential media organization is but it also means that we do not have the resources of cnn msnbc or the clinton campaign to constantly rebuff criticism yet if the press obeys considerations above informing the public we are no longer talking about a free press and we are no longer talking about an informed public wikileaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public even if many especially those in power would prefer not to see it wikileaks must publish it must publish and be damned \\nin this enlightening

spicer influential are they on their way out in your opinion what is going on here what do we need to be wary of what are we looking out for who are the players and how do they align with each other” kassam asked  “since inauguration it was really about four camps” ryun replied “it was the kushner camp it was the bannon camp it was the reince camp and it was the pence camp but i’m starting to think based off what i was hearing from yesterday and then reading reports this morning that this is becoming actually more of two camps  —   that it really is the national populists really led by bannon versus quite frankly  —   there’s no other way to describe them  —   the liberal new york city set that have come in ” ryun said the latter camp included “gary cohn dina powell” and others he described as democrats along with jared kushner and ivanka trump “god bless them they’re part of the trump family but let’s not kid ourselves they are part of the manhattan liberal set” he said of the latter duo  “the question that i have as i’m reading these reports  —   and i think we should start asking questions  —   who are they really what has been their experience what is their worldview because i’m starting to suspect their worldview does not line up with the campaign promises that trump was making” ryun said “the people that voted for donald trump voted for very specific things” he noted “they do want to see a wall they want to see immigration dealt with they want to see healthcare reform they want to see tax reform they want to see all of these things ” “watching what’s taking place i’m growing more and more concerned that some of the dynamics some of the voices in trump’s ear some of the influences  —   we should start asking questions are they starting to steer him in the wrong direction away from what got him into one of the most stunning victories in presidential history got him into the white house” ryun asked kassam returned to ryun’s description of the “liberal new york city set” and asked him to explain the importance of dina powell ryun noted powell is a fellow veteran of the bush white house “i was at the white house before she was but she came in she was head of presidential personnel in fact i think she was the   head of presidential personnel” he said he continued that after powell left the bush white house she worked for goldman sachs in new york “and now has come back really gotten involved with ivanka trump   day ” “i have real concerns not only about the new york liberal set that has come into the white house   …     i am more and more concerned about the goldman sachs people that have come into the administration” ryun professed  he said they have a “different worldview than the american people that voted trump in ” “you’ve got that worldview you’ve got the new york goldman sachs liberal set worldview and the real question here is which one is going to win out influencing the future direction of trump” he predicted “i thought really yesterday at first initially it was a reorganization by mcmaster of some of these things” ryun said of the news that steve bannon has been removed from the principals committee of the national security council “i’m a little more concerned that there is a serious power struggle going on ” “i’ve got to tell you my hope is that trump will say ‘i know what got me in i know what brought me to the white house steve bannon is really the lead cheerleader on that front keep steve close listen to steve keep pushing down this path” ryun advised “if he does there will be victory this year in regards to policy” he anticipated “he’s already going to have it this week with gorsuch i really do think we’re going to get something done with health care there’s going to be a massive step in the right direction i do think we’ve got a real shot at tax reform ” “you get a couple of these victories under your belt you keep going down this path then we’re going to start talking about what the second trump term looks like” he said “but if he starts to stray i’m concerned ” kassam asked where the republican national committee its former chairman reince priebus and sean spicer fit into this picture “you know i think they’re starting to realize that the new york set they’re not their friends” ryun replied “i think in a weird strange alliance that the rnc folks are realizing they’re basically going to become allies with bannon ” “this is all on the fly this is all really the last  hours” he added “if the other guys win i guarantee you bannon’s out reince is out spicer’s out the

just entered egyptian airspace early thursday on the final part of its journey suddenly the   jetliner jerked hard to the left then hard to the right circled and plunged   feet disappearing from the radar screens of greek and egyptian air traffic controllers that began a day of emergency rescuers scrambling officials issuing conflicting information and experts speculating about the fate of egyptair flight  which carried at least  people from roughly a dozen nations and was presumed to have crashed into the mediterranean sea egyptair initially said wreckage of the plane had been found with the help of searchers from greece but a senior official of the airline speaking on cnn retracted that assertion hours later egyptian officials suggested that terrorism was a more likely cause for the disappearance than mechanical failure but others cautioned that it was premature to make that judgment the loss of the flight was the second civilian aviation disaster to hit egypt in the past seven months it resurrected fears and speculation about the safety and security of egyptian aviation which has a history of lapses  —   as well as the specter of a security breach in paris where the plane took off the mystery of the plane’s demise also raised broader questions about the vulnerability of civilian air travel to terrorism flight  went missing against the backdrop of threats from militant extremist groups like the islamic state and al qaeda with networks linking europe to the middle east by thursday evening no group had claimed responsibility with differing reports about precisely what wreckage had been discovered president abdel fattah   of egypt ordered the armed forces to “take all measures necessary” to find the remains of the plane his office said in a statement the statement also said work had begun immediately “to unravel the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the egyptian aircraft and establish its causes ” as news of the missing plane spread in cairo relatives of those aboard rushed to the airport some overcome with grief and anger over the lack of information “pray for them” said a relative of a flight attendant who had just married “we don’t know anything ” earlier in the day egypt’s civil aviation minister sherif fathi acknowledged at a news conference that the cause might have been terrorism mr fathi said that “if you analyze the situation properly” the possibility of “having a terror attack is higher than the possibility” of technical failure egyptair said the pilot and   had nearly   hours of flying time between them officials from the interior ministry and cairo airport described them as experienced fliers with no known political affiliations the jetliner departed paris at  p m on wednesday the pilot spoke to greek air traffic controllers at  a m and nothing seemed out of the ordinary officials said three or four minutes later the plane made its last normal radar contact at  a m shortly after entering egyptian airspace the plane made a   turn to the left and then a full circle to the right first plunging to   feet from   feet and then to   feet at that point it disappeared from radar the greek defense minister panos kammenos said at a news conference on thursday afternoon there was also conflicting information about precisely how many passengers flight  was carrying  —    or  egyptair said early in the day that  passengers were aboard along with seven crew members and three members of airline security personnel but three infants also were reported to have been aboard and it was unclear if they had been counted at least  of the passengers were from egypt according to the airline with others from algeria belgium britain canada chad france iraq kuwait portugal saudi arabia and sudan the aircraft was delivered to egyptair in november  and had accumulated   hours of flying time according to data compiled by flightradar an aviation website such aircraft are typically built to last  or  years and there was no indication anything was mechanically amiss but the aircraft’s north africa itinerary in the previous two days was possibly more worrisome flightradar data showed it had flown round trips between cairo and asmara eritrea and between cairo and tunis before going to paris american and european officials have expressed concerns about security gaps in north african airports officials in egypt who have been under intense scrutiny since a bomb brought down a russian airliner over the sinai peninsula in october killing all  people on board declined to describe the events as a crash the aviation minister’s quick acknowledgment that terrorism might be a cause this time was in stark contrast to the government’s handling of the loss of the russian airliner which egyptian officials had insisted for months could not have been the result of terrorism the french president françois hollande after speaking by telephone with president sisi of egypt also raised the possibility of terrorism “the information that we have been able to gather  —   the prime minister the members of the government and of course the egyptian authorities  —   unfortunately confirm for us that this plane crashed at sea and has been lost” mr hollande said at the élysée palace mr hollande said that “no hypothesis was being ruled out” and that search teams from france greece and egypt were hoping to recover “debris that would enable us to know the truth ” he added “when we have the truth we must draw all the conclusions whether it is an accident or another hypothesis which everybody has in mind the terrorist hypothesis ” security at charles de gaulle airport outside paris where flight  departed was tightened after the terrorist attacks in and around the french capital in november and scrutiny of passengers and luggage was also stepped up in the wake of the bombing of brussels airport in march president obama was briefed by lisa o monaco his adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism and the administration offered “support and assistance” the white house said in a statement administration officials said it was too early to say what had caused the plane to vanish but they said they were sharing information from a terrorist watch list as well as other data with egyptian french and other investigators egyptair said the last radar contact with the plane had been about  a m when it was  miles off the egyptian coast greek officials put the last radar contact at a minute earlier at  a m the greek authorities began a search operation deploying a   military transport plane at  a m  —   nearly two hours after the last radar contact  —   the plane emitted a signal although it was not clear whether that was an emergency distress signal sent by a crew member or an automated signal from the plane’s onboard computers “we don’t know if the pilot had something to do with this or if it is just the plane sending it” said ihab raslan a spokesman for the egyptian civil aviation ministry in the october crash of the russian jetliner the plane broke up in midair  minutes after takeoff from the red sea resort city of sharm el sheikh the islamic state whose local affiliate is fighting the egyptian military in the sinai peninsula claimed that it had brought down the plane an airbus   the crash dealt a crippling blow to egypt’s tourism industry which had already declined sharply in recent years it also helped precipitate a decline in the value of the egyptian currency in recent months russia and britain have suspended flights to sharm el sheikh since the crash the egyptian investigation has yet to officially identify the cause but president vladimir v putin of russia and mr sisi discussed the resumption of flights in a telephone call on may  according to a statement from the kremlin the last major crash involving an egyptair plane occurred in  when a boeing  traveling from cairo struck a hill near the tunis airport killing  of the  people on board in march a hijacker wearing a fake explosives vest diverted an egyptair domestic flight to cyprus but a standoff ended with his arrest and no injuries the cypriot authorities later described the man seif eldin mustafa as “psychologically disturbed ” he is currently battling extradition to egypt egypt has come under criticism in the past for its lack of transparency in aviation accidents

       " 'first day of syria peace talks quickly descends into quarreling  the new york times astana kazakhstan  —   the first    meeting between syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations the new round of talks arranged by russia and turkey in astana the capital of kazakhstan was meant to showcase moscow’s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and its new understanding with the turkish government a leading sponsor of the rebels but the syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly mohammad   of the army of islam in his opening statement labeled the government “a bloody despotic regime” backed by “vengeful sectarian militias” and called for it to release what he said were   women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges that led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced kazakh officials to call for calm several participants said the lead government negotiator bashar   speaking to reporters after the opening session responded by calling the opposition delegation “armed terrorist groups” and accused them of “impertinent” and “provocative” behavior the tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for russia the syrian government’s most powerful backer as the russian government tries to show its approach can accomplish more than the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the united states and the united nations expectations for progress had been low many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months largely in secret among russia turkey and iran the meeting in astana meant to send the message that russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence was markedly different from the united   talks that have taken place  in recent winters in geneva delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the rixos hotel in the remote kazakh capital built  years ago on the orders of nursultan nazarbayev the former communist boss who has been the country’s president since it became independent with the collapse of the soviet union in  he has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with russia and turkey palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside as a    duo wearing evening gowns played “strangers in the night” and the theme from “titanic ” western diplomats largely sidelined huddled in the hotel’s irish pub and the united states ambassador to kazakhstan who was invited over iran’s objections and attended only as an observer avoided reporters when the americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in geneva the meetings took place at the palace of nations one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the th century that have housed the united nations since it was formed after world war ii those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war an order associated with american leadership  —   or domination  —   amid the tensions of the cold war now the role of the united states in syria and across the middle east is widely seen as having receded under former president barack obama and its future remains uncertain mr obama while backing some rebel groups resisted deeper american involvement in the syrian conflict ceding the leading role to russia his successor president trump has signaled broad approval of russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on syria officially all sides in the syrian conflict describe the goal of the talks in astana as reaffirming a tenuous   in order to revive the geneva talks the   started in december and known formally as a cessation of hostilities is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups including the levant conquest front and the islamic state a strengthening of the cessation across syria the united nations envoy staffan de mistura said monday could pave the way for discussion of more substantive political issues at talks scheduled for february in geneva the united nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in astana but mr de mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in astana could be a russian effort to ultimately replace the geneva discussions which the russian government has criticized the syrian government and the russians have long argued that the geneva framework calling for a transitional body with full governing powers does not require president bashar   to step down while the opposition has insisted that it does but as a practical matter an increasing number of western countries including the united states and even some of the rebels’ backers in the middle east like turkey have moved toward the russian position with turkey mainly concerned about checking kurdish militants within its borders and in syria and the united states focused on battling islamic state militants they have stopped pushing loudly for mr assad to step down ahead of a settlement instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement there were signs on monday of russian willingness to apply pressure on the syrian government to keep the talks on track the tense exchanges in astana were followed by a russian statement unusually critical of the syrian government the   news agency ria novosti said monitors of a   in syria were “particularly concerned about sporadic violations of truce by the syrian government forces”  —   echoing a complaint of rebels russia’s   air campaign which began in the fall of  helped forces loyal to mr assad drive rebels from their foothold late last year in half of the important city of aleppo an offensive criticized by the opposition for indiscriminate air and artillery attacks on civilians

lamented that she had to repeat herself answering reporters  questions regarding comey s firing with  i think i ve already answered this sanders  approach to handling the press is due to years of

that wasfamily mattersthe daughter of former twotime republican presidential candidate and former arkansas gov mike huckabee sanders grew up in politics in a way that many kids don t huckabee said i always say that when most kids are  or  years old out jumping rope she was sitting at the kitchen table listening to political commentators analyze poll results  he saidsanders was consistently ingrained in her father s own political aspirations serving as his field director for his  gubernatorial reelection campaign and national political director during his  presidential bid in  she ran his presidential campaignbut it was growing up in the arkansas governor s mansion as a young teenager that prepared sanders for her current role as deputy press secretary huckabee saidhuckabee became

she had to as a matter of survival  huckabee said  she s got a very sweet heart but she s tough and she can handle herself she s had to take all kinds of gruff from her brothers so she s pretty fearless huckabee added that as his youngest child   and his only daughter at that   sanders was at time spoiled by her parents but even still the huckabees sought to instill a spirit of hard work in all the children he said she s always been raised to tell the truth take responsibility for her own actions to work hard for what she wants in life even as teenagers when they went to things like church camp we wouldn t pay their tuition  he said  we told them that they needed to work in the cafeteria or snack bar to cover their costs   not because it was absolutely necessary but because we

prime minister and a national leader           hariri s resignation last saturday read out on television from saudi arabia came as a shock even to his aides and further embroiled beirut in a regional contest between riyadh and tehran hariri s exit fueled wide speculation that the sunni muslim politician long an ally of riyadh was coerced into stepping down by saudi arabia as it seeks to hit back against iran and its lebanese shi ite ally hezbollah in his resignation speech hariri denounced iran and hezbollah for sowing strife in arab states and said he feared assassination his father a former prime minister was killed by a bomb in      saudi arabia has denied reports he is under house arrest but hariri has issued no statements himself to that effect and has not denied that his movements are being restricted       keeping hariri with restricted freedom in riyadh is an attack on lebanese sovereignty our dignity is his dignity we will work with foreign states to return him to beirut  said the senior lebanese official speaking on condition of anonymity because the government had yet to declare that position saudi arabia says hariri resigned because hezbollah which was included in hariri s coalition government had  hijacked  lebanon s political system hariri aides had until thursday denied he was under house arrest but took a dramatically different tone after a meeting of the

hezbollah saudi arabia blessed the government at the time but has been fiercely critical of the haririled government since he stepped down saying it failed to act against hezbollah whose guerrilla army is far more powerful than the weak state saudi arabia had wanted hariri to take a tougher stance toward hezbollah and he failed to do so the fourth source said  he was functioning as if it is business as usual so the saudis had to accelerate the process and to force a resignation  saudi arabia this week lumped lebanon together with hezbollah as parties that are hostile to it breaking with a longestablished policy that has drawn a line between them and raising concerns of further saudi measures hariri flew to saudi arabia last friday the top lebanese government official speaking on condition of anonymity said  lebanon is heading toward asking foreign and arab states to put pressure on saudi arabia to release prime minister saad alhariri  the official said hariri was still lebanon s prime minister echoing other lebanese government officials who say his resignation had not been received by aoun and his government therefore remained in place     the resignation of hariri a business tycoon whose family made its fortune in saudi arabia happened at the same time as a wave of arrests of saudi princes and businessmen accused of corruption by crown prince mohammed bin salman the senior lebanese politician close to hariri said  when he went to saudi arabia he was asked to stay there and ordered to resign they ordered him to read his resignation statement and he has been held under house arrest since  two us officials said the saudis led by crown prince mohammed had  encouraged  hariri to leave office the fourth source said  he is under controlled movement by the

in benghazi libya susan e rice was at the center of conflict her statements scrutinized and criticized now she finds herself back in the cross hairs as her handling of intelligence involving president trump’s associates comes into question a longtime democratic foreign policy official who served as president barack obama’s last national security adviser ms rice has become an inkblot test in the controversy over russian meddling in last year’s election republicans see a partisan who mined intelligence reports to spy on mr trump’s team democrats see a scapegoat tarred for doing her job and used as a distraction from an f b i investigation into mr trump’s associates at issue are her requests for the identities of americans caught up in electronic surveillance of foreigners as cited in reports provided to her by intelligence agencies americans who were affiliated with mr trump ms rice went public in her own defense on television and twitter on tuesday neither confirming nor disputing that she made such requests but arguing that any she might have made were proper and necessary not part of political espionage against the trump campaign “the allegation is that somehow the obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes” ms rice told the journalist andrea mitchell on msnbc “that’s absolutely false ” ms rice said she had sometimes asked for the names of americans whose identities were redacted in her daily intelligence briefings in order to understand the context of what she was being told the purpose she said was “to do our jobs” but “absolutely not for any political purpose to spy expose anything ” she added that she had never made public the identities of any trump associates mentioned in intelligence surveillance “i leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would” ms rice said republicans have argued that “the real story” as mr trump put it is not the f b i investigation into contacts between his associates and russia but the conduct of the obama administration mr trump said on monday that he had been the target of a “crooked scheme” by mr obama’s team and he followed up on tuesday by retweeting a link from the drudge report “rice ordered spy docs on trump” fellow republicans seized on reports about ms rice in the conservative news media senator rand paul of kentucky called the reports a “smoking gun” and said ms rice should be subpoenaed to testify senator lindsey graham of south carolina said congress should look into the reports senator tom cotton of arkansas pointed to the dispute over ms rice’s role in characterizing the  attack on the diplomatic compound in benghazi which killed the american ambassador and three other american officials “susan rice is the typhoid mary of the obama administration foreign policy” mr cotton said on the hugh hewitt radio show “every time something went wrong she seemed to turn up in the middle of it ” where republicans detect scandal democrats see a smoke screen mr trump and his allies have been looking for indications of wrongdoing by mr obama’s team for a month since the president accused his predecessor of tapping telephones at trump tower during last year’s campaign no evidence has publicly surfaced to substantiate that claim and it has been widely dismissed having failed to prove the assertion mr trump and his allies have turned to ms rice as the national security adviser she received intelligence briefings six days a week last year during the campaign some of mr trump’s associates were caught up in eavesdropping of foreign officials when americans who are not the target of a warrant are mentioned in reports about such surveillance their identities are obscured and they are typically referred to as u s person one or u s person two but top officials like the national security adviser can ask the intelligence agencies to disclose the names a process called unmasking if the intelligence agencies agree the briefer typically provides the identities orally former national security officials have said that ms rice was justified in asking for the names of trump associates referred to in reports that intelligence agencies sent to her last year the white house was concerned about attempts by the russian government to interfere in the election and she had an obvious need to be fully informed they said ms rice said tuesday that the russian meddling was a serious issue “it was a grave concern to all of us in the national security team of the president and to the president himself” she said “we took this issue very seriously we thought it was crucial to defend the integrity of our election process ” she added “for us not to try to understand it would be a dereliction of duty ” mr trump’s aides dismissed ms rice’s comments “lyin’ leakin’ susan rice stammered through her soft ball interview with dem pr person andrea mitchell” dan scavino jr the white house social media director wrote on twitter sean spicer the white house press secretary said ms rice’s actions seemed to contradict her previous public comments after representative devin nunes the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee announced last month that he had seen reports indicating that mr trump or his associates might have been “incidentally” swept up in the monitoring of foreigners ms rice told pbs “i know nothing about this i was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that count today ” mr spicer suggested that ms rice had not been forthcoming “she was the one who went out and said quote that she had nothing to do with this on a program a few weeks ago and now you see more and more reports” he told reporters “it’s not for me to decide who should testify or how they should do it” mr spicer added “but i do think that there’s a sharp contrast between a few weeks ago when she was very public in saying she quote didn’t have any clue what chairman nunes was talking about and yet now we’re finding out that she’s trying to figure out some kind of friendly way of discussing this ” ms rice responded on twitter later in the day “i said i did not know what reports nunes was referring to when he spoke to the press” she wrote “i still do not ”',\n",

       " 'this city is  latino and the face of a new california  the new york times santa ana calif  —   vicente sarmiento remembers when the local republican party here posted uniformed guards at polling stations in a closely fought state assembly race three decades ago and they hoisted signs in english and spanish warning that noncitizens were prohibited from voting the guards were removed after state elections officials threatened legal action such tactics would never take place today in this city  miles southeast of los angeles where mr sarmiento is now the mayor pro tem all seven members of the city council including mr sarmiento are latino as are  percent of the   people who live here leer en español » these days santa ana stands as the face of a new california a state where latinos have more influence in everyday life  —   electorally culturally and demographically  —   than almost anywhere else in the country there are limits to the transformation here both in economics where latinos still lag far behind the state as a whole and in politics where remarkable gains in latino power have not yet translated to the most powerful statewide offices but the latino progress in this state offers a glimpse of how much of the country will probably look in coming decades immigrants living illegally in california are entitled to driver’s licenses their children can receive   health insurance local law enforcement officials generally do not provide information to federal immigration authorities as they do in many other parts of the country on a smaller if no less symbolic level the first thing the santa ana city council did when it went   in  was pass a law requiring simultaneous translation of all of its meetings to spanish “there is now  —   unlike before  —   a comfort level with knowing there’s a lot of latinos living here and latino leadership here” said mr sarmiento  sitting in the law office he keeps in his house the signs of demographic and political change are everywhere in a city that is an easy   drive from disneyland the historic downtown is clustered around what the official city map calls “fourth street” but everyone here knows as “calle cuatro ” a twirl of the dial on a car radio reveals a choice of   stations the sidewalks of calle cuatro are lined with stands selling churritos and tostilocos “there’s no attempt to whitewash the city anymore” said aurelia rivas  a student working at her parents’ fruit and snack stand one afternoon referring to the annual day of the dead celebration she added “it’s like everyone knows that día de los muertos is going to be just as big and important of a celebration as the fourth of july ” the power and presence of latinos in this community in orange county  —   itself once a bastion of republicanism  —   is echoed up and down the california coast latinos now make up just under  percent of the state’s population projected to increase to  percent by  the leaders of both houses of the legislature are latino as is the secretary of state the current mayor of los angeles and the previous mayor more than  percent of latino voters in the nation live in california said mark hugo lopez the director of hispanic research at the pew research center there are   latinos holding state local and federal office in california second only to texas but hispanics in texas are overwhelmingly democrats in a state dominated by republicans in california the democrats are solidly in control and hispanics are a crucial and growing part of their base and help explain why hillary clinton has a huge advantage over donald j trump “over the last  years we have really solidified the power especially in the legislature” said lorena gonzalez a democratic member of the state assembly from san diego “people are more afraid of being seen as not supporting latinos than supporting them you see this most clearly with the rhetoric of republicans here  —   they are falling all over themselves to support latino candidates ” the limits to the gains can be glaring too the latino unemployment rate in california was at   percent in august compared to   percent overall more than  percent of latinos in the state live below the poverty level significantly higher than the  percent overall the disparities are shown in education as well  percent of latinos  years old or older have bachelor’s degrees compared to  percent overall and  percent of latino households own their home well below the statewide homeownership figure of  percent “latino political power is not the panacea nor does it equate to instant gains overall or lifting people out of poverty” said kevin de león a democrat and the leader of the state senate “the fact that we have political power i think means we’ve started that journey ” prominent latinos say that even though the climate has changed markedly they still encounter reminders of lingering prejudice in the way some feel they are treated by the police or are scrutinized as they travel through wealthier and whiter parts of orange county anthony rendon the democratic assembly speaker said that prejudice can include dismissive stereotypes about latinos in politics “there’s a tendency to think that i am only going to focus on certain types of issues that i am only going to focus on certain types of population” mr rendon said “it’s sometimes a surprise that i am concerned about environmental issues ” and the political successes have their limits there have only been two latinos elected to statewide office in california’s modern history including the current secretary of state alex padilla mr padilla said the absence of latinos in statewide elected posts reflected the challenges of running in a state as large as california rather than evidence of   sentiment “we’re past that” he said “california is a big state it’s a populous state it’s difficult and expensive to run in ” one lingering issue is voting rules although santa ana has an   city council there are no latino council members in neighboring anaheim even though the city is almost half latino anaheim like several other communities elects its council at large rather than by district which tends to put latinos who turn out smaller numbers than the general electorate at a disadvantage still job postings across california routinely require applicants to speak spanish mayor eric garcetti of los angeles who is fluent in spanish said he makes a point at news conferences of setting aside time to speak to   media “we are well past the tipping point  —   everywhere” mr garcetti said “the shift within  years from being the most   state to being the most embracing state for the integration of immigrants has been pretty breathtaking ” when cruz bustamante a former lieutenant governor ran for governor in  he came under fire because he would not renounce ties to a chicano student group mecha or movimiento estudiantil chicano de atzlan “that would just not happen now” ms gonzalez of the state assembly said in santa ana the change has stirred debate over what latino lawmakers should do with their power and the challenges of dealing with a new minority  —     about  percent of residents here are white  percent are asian and  percent are   “we also have to be sensitive to   voters” said miguel pulido the mayor whose family immigrated from mexico city in  “we have a case now when the majority became the minority ’’ but michele martinez a santa ana councilwoman since  said the city council has not done enough to promote the city’s latino identity “a lot of my friends my colleagues they grew up here in a time when they weren’t allowed to speak spanish” she said “well now we’re more than allowed but we don’t throw it in your face we’re a little reluctant to be seen as too latino and i don’t get that ” she has tried without success to persuade her colleagues to funnel more money to a local mexican cultural and art center and help fund the center’s annual día de los muertos celebration this year local activists pressed the council to end a longstanding contract with federal immigration authorities to house immigrants who entered the country illegally in the city jail while the council voted to phase the contract out over years ms martinez was the only council member who voted to end the contract immediately mr sarmiento argued that one sign of

       " 'why it’s necessary to relax into a stretch in a previous article  i discussed stretching—namely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch\\ni am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical “stretching mindset” but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use\\nhow not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch— avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to “hold fast” and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all\\nthe muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving\\neven when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the “ antistretch reflex ” to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you’ll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning\\nhowever if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is\\n\\nrelax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice—just ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your “joints” actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques\\nthe most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of “relaxing into a stretch”—with thanks to pavel tsatsouline for naming the concept\\nto use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and then…sit and wait\\n\\nyes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch—in other words you’re going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive\\nthis is not something that happens quickly—from my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where it’s acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion\\nas you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can’t go any further—this is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i can’t judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop\\nthis technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the “relax into stretch” family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditation—mentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation\\nor you can try “forced relaxation” where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax\\n\\neither way you slice it don’t just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results\\nread more why stretching is essential for the body with  beginner stretches to get you started \\n',\n",

marginally won by mike pence – a confident slightly smarmy debater very much in the mold of those calculating washington dc politicians who are destroying america\\n\\ntim kaine hillary clinton’s more voluble running mate didn’t flop but he was visibly less comfortable than the squarejawed pence frequently interrupting the indiana governor jamming his preprogrammed attacks on donald trump into every answer with admirable tedious efficiency\\n\\ntheir performances almost perfectly reflected the priorities of each candidate kaine was a hyperbriefed trumpthumping machine barking the gop nominee’s name as if it were a slur some  times – more than twice the number of times pence mentioned clinton’s according a politico tally\\n\\npence on the other hand seemed less concerned with outandout defending his running mate than ropeadoping away from uncomfortable questions his standard response was to pucker his face and mock kaine as “ridiculous” for pelting him with facts statistics and actual trump quotes\\n\\nand if kaine who doesn’t have an especially close personal relationship with clinton warmly referred to “hillary” as if the two were the best of friends pence maintained a wary rhetorical distance from trump he behaved less like an affectionate pal than a guy getting paid to do a job a pet employee reassuring disgruntled coworkers that their unpopular boss was actually a great guy really if only you guys got to know him\\n\\nin the end you got the sense that pence did as much maybe more to burnish his own brand than trump’s – and even if he’s widely deemed the winner what lasting good will it do for his undisciplined selfdefeating nominee here are five takeaways\\n\\n hillary clinton is lucky she’s facing trump instead of pence even after having his leonine head handed to him at the first presidential debate last week there’s no decisive evidence that trump is taking prep for sunday’s second round in st louis any more seriously than he took prep for the first the same cannot be said for pence a true professional who huddled with wisconsin gov scott walker for a week and produced a focused performance parrying every attack with a sharp assault on the unholy trinity of clinton sins emails the foundation and her foreign policy failings as secretary of state\\n\\npence was as ungoadable as trump was easily gulled when an aggressive kaine demanded he defend his running mate’s comments on everything from declaring mexican immigrants “rapists” to trump’s suggestion that the us encourage other countries to develop nukes pence mocked him “did you work on that one a long time because that had a lot of creative lines in it”\\n\\nin the real world outside the farmville va debate hall pence has contradicted or contrasted himself from

mexicans and a disabled reporter pence juked and refused to answer – which allowed kaine to declare “hes refused to defend his running mate  and yet hes asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend he said in one of the debate’s few memorable exchanges\\n\\nbut he came off as a bit nervous like a frustrated school kid trying to disgorge a memorized speech if only his rowdy

“genius” for “using” the tax code to avoid paying taxes – but the real genius may have been pence who figured out the best way to answer the thorniest questions about trump was to respond with an

talkingpoint with televangelistical conviction “donald trump is a businessman  he actually built a business” pence intoned “like everybody he faced some pretty tough times  years ago”\\n\\npence

       " 'comment on report exposes inner workings of facebook and how clinton loyalists control your newsfeed by marlene   claire bernish \\ncensorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press — for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton — and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted \\nfacebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards — but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown \\nand facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable — and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case \\nrecent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebook’s removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan thị kim phúc — who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang \\nthat photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort — but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity — and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image \\nultimately the social media company reversed course in that case — but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa park’s arrest \\nbut taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  \\n“trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters” \\nin the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a “mistake” \\naccording to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the company’s elite executives \\nin addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals \\n“all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg” the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others \\ncompany spokeswoman christine chen explained “facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand” \\nfor those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors \\nindeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency — prominent palestinian media organizations — without explanation or even a specific example given for justification \\nalthough three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts’ owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an ‘error’ \\nin fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences \\nearlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebook’s suppression of conservative outlets via its “trending topics” section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics — either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots \\nhowever considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative \\nin a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta — an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks — penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part \\n“and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids” \\nafter a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards — and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives \\nsenior members of facebook’s policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which — though welcome — might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  \\n“in the weeks ahead we’re going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interest—even if they might otherwise violate our standards” \\nwhile the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility — and grave importance — of free speech  ',\n",

       " 'edward albee a playwright intent on naming and goading the beast within  the new york times edward albee never expected or even wanted you to like his plays “like” is too pale and friendly a word for the   emotions he hoped to elicit rage and bewilderment fear and loathing and that grand old aristotelian couple pity and terror these were all welcome and entirely appropriate responses to have in the theater of mr albee one of the genuinely great dramatists of the last century who died on friday at  if you left one of his plays feeling good about yourself then it would seem that mr albee hadn’t done his job but the real problem probably would have been that you hadn’t been paying attention “you don’t listen” as a character in one of his   plays kept saying to anyone who would  —   sorry wouldn’t  —   listen the challenge within that accusation rang through everything he wrote that play “listening” was the first work by mr albee that i wrote about as a critic for the new york times first staged in  it had been revived in new york in the fall of  by the invaluable signature theater company created by james houghton who died in august which was devoting a season to mr albee’s more obscure work by that time new york critics and audiences had mostly turned their backs on mr albee it had been a decade since he had had new work produced in the city and the feeling was that he belonged to an earlier artier generation that took its provocative intellectual postures far too seriously sure the consensus seemed to go “who’s afraid of virginia woolf ” the marital boxing match of a play that had been made into a movie starring elizabeth taylor and richard burton was great but be honest now did anyone really understand such arcane plays as “tiny alice” and “the lady from dubuque” with all their cryptic cosmic talk being just another new york sheep i had probably absorbed that perspective without even thinking about it but as i left “listening” and its companion piece “counting the ways” in  i realized that my mind was still churning in excitement and agitation and a bit of annoyance in ways it seldom did at the end of any show i wrote in the times that i was certainly glad to be able to listen to mr albee again he in turn wrote me a crisp and courteous letter saying it was refreshing to be treated fairly again as it turned out new york was more than willing to embrace mr albee again o k maybe not embrace since that implies huggability writing about mr albee the most exacting of semanticists makes you question every word you use that same autumn of  saw in addition to the signature season the new york premiere off broadway at the vineyard theater of mr albee’s “three tall women” a portrait of the three ages of a rich and selfish suburbanite who was clearly modeled on the playwright’s adoptive mother it became the   play of the season for people who no doubt included fashionable captious   americans rather like its title character it also won the pulitzer prize for drama and so began one of the greatest second acts in any dramatist’s career soon mr albee would be back on broadway again first with an exquisite revival of his “a delicate balance” in  plays that had seemed annoying and obscure a couple of decades earlier including “tiny alice” and “the lady from dubuque” were reincarnated to illuminating effect one of his new works “the goat or who is sylvia” which opened on broadway in  put to rest any notions that mr albee might have started playing nice with his audiences the titular animal was the love and lust object of the play’s anguished married hero first portrayed by bill pullman you can listen to mr albee  —   in the “last words” interview i conducted with him some years ago  —   contentedly cataloging the different points in the production at which theatergoers walked out he didn’t even mention the bit of dialogue that made me think “no surely he did not say that”  —   a description of a man dandling an infant on his lap and realizing to his distress that he had acquired an erection in  mr albee was evidently still quite capable of making even jaded critics who had done their time with the naked fornicators of fringe theater squirm but it is never just the shocking detail that unsettles with mr albee what’s most disturbing always is his insistence that our most primitive instincts keep asserting themselves in even the most civilized settings like a minotaur at a cocktail party and usually they wrestle us to the ground “violence violence” chants the mousy honey with a cheerleader’s delight in “who’s afraid of virginia woolf” and nasty eruptions of the impulse to hurt and its frequent conflation with the sex drive were always a part of the    with mr albee so was death with and without a capital d most pointedly in “all over” and “the lady from dubuque” but its shadow looms large in everything mr albee wrote that unsentimental insistence on our mortality may have been the biggest turnoff to new york theatergoers of the   century mr albee repeatedly dared to ask what most of us retire to the closets of our minds for as long as possible the fact of our inevitable ends and what it means for our tenuous   i should say that few dramatists of the th and st centuries matched mr albee as a spinner of filigree dialogue it can hold its own with that of wilde shaw coward and stoppard mr albee loved words and wordplay  —   sometimes to the point of giddiness but he also made it clear that he fully grasped the inadequacy of language as a means of staving off  —   never mind defining  —   the darkness that waited to claim his characters performing his work required to borrow a title of his a delicate balance “if i am sharp it is because i am neither less nor more than human” says agnes in that play and one of the joys of my job as a theater critic has been watching performers actresses in particular discover that balance with an appropriate mix of glee and bitterness bravura and uncertainty kathleen turner rosemary harris uta hagen marian seldes and elaine stritch all created   performances in albee works i met mr albee several times socially and professionally the first time he pointed out that like so many people i had mispronounced his name “it’s   ben not   ” generally he was gentlemanly polite reserved and attentive in a way i associate with a   era there was power in his gaze though an assessing twinkle that you suspected might easily be fanned into a flame that could scorch once i saw him for an interview the day after i had attended a new play of his at the mccarter theater in princeton n j i told mr albee that my   nephew whom i had taken to the show had greatly enjoyed the production “good” said mr albee who then paused and added “i hope he didn’t enjoy it too much ”',\n",

       " 'is the us headed towards war in syria by yves smith \\nyves here this real news network interview with lawrence wilkerson  not surprisingly is pretty sobering the rush transcript didn’t have apostrophes so i added them as best i could but there are sure to be some spots i missed \\nsharmini peries trnn welcome to the real news network i\\x92’m sharmini peries coming to you from baltimore \\nthe obama administration is currently considering a proposal to send more arms to cia backed anti assad forces in syria according to the washington post obama has not made a decision yet and could leave it up to whoever wins the election in november this of course raises questions of what would a president hillary clinton or president donald trump do in syria this has also been the topic at the presidential debates recently \\njoining us to discuss the clinton’s\\x92 and trump\\x92’s approach as to foreign policy is larry wilkerson larry is a retired united states army soldier and former chief of staff to the united states secretary of state colin powell he’s also just published an article in national interest written together with gordon adams about this topic larry thank you so much for joining us today \\nlarry wilkerson thanks for having me sharmini \\nperies so larry in your recent piece titled no hillary clinton\\x92’s foreign policy judgment isn\\x92’t as good as everyone says you argued that a case for clinton as a better foreign policy president on the basis on knowledge and experience now factoring all of this in what\\x92’s going on in washington in terms of how they should behave or what foreign policy actions or military actions need to be taking place in syria how do you think hillary clinton would act \\nwilkerson i’\\x92m very concerned about it i can tell you that right up front her posture with regard to syria in general when she was secretary of state and some of the remarks she\\x92s made during the campaign lead me to believe that she\\x92’ll be very bellicose with regard to syria i hope i\\x92’m wrong i hope a better judgement prevails but as i said in the national interest article i’m not all that convinced of it that\\x92’s based primarily on her track record with regard to libya which is now a disaster and it\\x92’s my understanding that she was one of the if not the principle advocates of action in libya when president obama somewhat reluctantly decided to do it following nato into that country and she was also an advocate of the war in iraq and regime change there so in those two instances her judgement was flawed seriously flawed you could argue and based on her rhetoric with regards towards syria i certainly don’\\x92t want to see that kind of judgement continued in that regard \\nperies and in the recent debate she was advocating a no fly zone over syria what does that mean and what implications will it have in terms of geopolitical allegiances at this time \\nwilkerson we\\x92’re not dealing with a libyan air force or an iraqi air force or indeed a syrian air force what we\\x92’re dealing with here is russian air forces perhaps even as you and i were discussing eventually chinese air forces so they\\x92’re not there now i don\\x92’t think and the syrian air forces so if we go in to establish a no fly zone and we\\x92re serious about it the first airplane that penetrates that zone is all important because you\\x92ve just about got to shoot it down if it’s a russian airplane you\\x92re in trouble because you\\x92ve now performed an act of war against russia and syria what that means we\\x92ll just have to wait and see but i don\\x92’t think it\\x92ll mean anything good for either side or ultimately for syria \\nso we\\x92’re talking about if we lay down something like a no fly zone and say this is it as of midnight on such and such a time no aircraft can fly through here and suddenly  minutes later even a russian aircraft flies though we have two choices we shoot it down and risk war with russia and that has all kinds of ramifications that are outside syria as well as in syria or we back off our claim and look like ineffectual boobs i don\\x92’t think either of those outcomes is conducive to us national security interests so i don\\x92’t think we should go there in the first place \\nperies larry recently i did an interview with former cia analyst ray mcgovern and he said that president putin in russia sees the next few months before potential clinton presidency as a window of opportunity for consolidating russia\\x92’s position in the ukraine and in syria now many world leaders are predicting that a clinton as you have just done will likely to escalate the situation particularly in syria that this is an area that president obama has been restrained with do you think that ray is correct that putin consolidating his power and will hillary clinton in her assessment go ahead on with putin \\nwilkerson i’\\x92m concerned about it as i said before because of her previous actions and because of some of the people she has advising her that look a lot like the people who were advising george w bush in his first administration from  of which i was a rather intimate member so i am concerned about it i hope that once she is in the oval office and if she indeed she\\x92s elected and she gets all the briefings and is brought up to speed and so forth and she gets the council of her military leaders she will be more circumspect and be more rational let us say than she is sometimes compelled to be on the political circuit and on the campaign trail that\\x92’s my hope but as i said based on her track record i have some concern perhaps not as much as ray but i still have some concern \\nperies now there\\x92’s been a number of other defense analyst in recent years who argue that the president has relatively little room to maneuver because the intelligence community the defense department and the state department are the ones that really policy strategy to what extent is that correct science you\\x92ve been at the center of all of this \\nwilkerson defense department does have an enormous amount of influence on the national security decision making process there\\x92’s no question about that as do other nefarious influences like lockheedmartin halliburton and all the usual suspects we\\x92ve heard about who influence congressional decision making and ultimately influence where the money goes and so forth i think probably in this particular instance though with regard to syria what i’\\x92m hearing is the military and particularly the joint chiefs of staff are reluctant to enter this trade with potential for starting a shooting war with russia \\nso i hope that what i’m hearing is correct and that they will act as a break on anything precipitant military action that secretary then president clinton or president trump for that matter would be willing or want to order \\nlet me just say that trump has been all over the sheet of music if you will on this but the remarks i have heard that resonate with me are those that would keep us out of these small wars on the periphery of empire if you will they cost a fortune in blood and treasure and don\\x92’t really promise to and rarely do solve anything they certainly don\\x92’t bring peace to instable regions and regions in conflict that syria is today they just make things worse \\nperies then finally larry when hillary clinton became the secretary of state and then there was this very public pronouncement of resetting relations with russia what went wrong why are we where we are now where she\\x92s accusing the russians of hacking into emails and as you know there\\x92’s controversy over what she actually said in the debate in terms of the russian involvement in all of this why is she escalating this and what went wrong with resetting the relations with russia \\nwilkerson what went wrong with resetting the relationship was us the us of a we have wasted no opportunity to make mr putin more powerful politically in his own country as soon as he figured out that sticking his fingers in washington\\x92s eyes was a winning political formula you could guarantee you were going to get more fingers in our eyes more so than that geopolitically and geostrategically that is to say in the heart of russia\\x92’s near abroad we have been making moves from ukraine to georgia and we have been making moves that anyone including myself being the ruler of a country first erstwhile great power and seeing it happen would be responding to and responding to with the elements of national power which i have that can compensate for weakness that i have too \\nby that i mean i\\x92d be responding with everything from cyber warfare to little green men to whatever i had that was competent and powerful in my arsenal that i felt like i could win with against the united states and ultimately against nato that\\x92’s precisely what putin has been doing you could almost sit down and map it every time we make a mistake they capitalize on that mistake i don\\x92’t just mean mistakes as in execution or mistakes in being in somewhere where we shouldn\\x92t be at in a particular time i mean policy mistakes the policy mistake most glaringly pushing ourselves into russia\\x92’s near abroad and nato along with us with ballistic missile defense with exercises and so forth \\nif i were putin i would\\x92ve responded the same way i think that i\\x92d have been just as smart as he has and i\\x92d capitalize on my streets against weaknesses and i would\\x92ve gained the political capital that he\\x92s gained in the course of this time it\\x92’s not all totally our fault but a whole lot of it is \\nperies so if we are collecting our thoughts here larry russian chinese now possibly iranian collaboration over syria are serious times \\nwilkerson and russia exercising for the first time since the death of anwar sadat with the egyptians russia selling major armaments to the egyptians for the first time since i think about that same time period the world is changing power is shifting and the united states needs not to be fearful of such changes but it needs to be a lot smarter of how it plays those changes to its own benefits \\none of the things it needs to be most hard about is fear of deployments of its own military forces to get engaged in things like we\\x92ve been engaged in for the past  years things like afghanistan things like iraq things like syria and so forth we really have no capability to influence these conflicts these basically civil wars and so forth trying to do so from the opening as we did in afghanistan with mujahideen for example by having the cia essentially arm everybody that we can find that looks like he might be a freedom fighter only to discover months or maybe half a year or so later that they’\\x92re anything but freedom fighters \\nindeed they\\x92’re using some of the weapons that we sold them on our troops or on our own formations is just not the answer it simply doesn\\x92’t work clandestinely or openly to the support elements in these conflicts that we know basically don\\x92’t have a hare\\x92s breath chance of winning the mistake in syria has been as i said all along that is our attempt to get rid of bashar alassad we need to face up to that mistake we need to be more receptive to his remaining in power and some guys the best we can probably get at the negotiating table is that maybe he\\x92ll be gone sometime in the unspecified future \\nbut we need to understand that sometimes we have to give a little too especially if we want to stop the bloodshed in syria which is reaching proportions where everyone in the world ought to be appalled at \\nperies

       " ' republican judge rules that doctors can freely refuse to treat people but only some people abortion became a legal procedure in  according to the supreme court it s about a woman s right to privacy more than  years later a republican judge put a new spin on the abortion debate he ruled that it s fine for a doctor to discriminate against a woman who s ever had an abortion they can discriminate against men too but only if the man was born with female body partsthe affordable care act obamacare forbids discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity it also forbids discrimination based on whether a woman has had an abortion in other words the federal government has applied a fairly broad definition to sex discrimination as they shouldus justice reed o connor has a different vision though he ruled that sex discrimination has only one meaning   discrimination against a woman for being a woman or a man for being a man as slate points out though who is to determine who is a man or who is a womanbut o connor recognizes only one kind of sex discrimination hostility against a man or woman for being a man or a woman this belief directly contradicts supreme court authority it also doesn t make much sense since it only raises the key question of who decides whether an individual is a man or a woman is discrimination against an intersex person not sex discrimination what about a person with ambiguous genitalia who identifies as male still o connor got away with this blinkered understanding of sex in blocking federal guidelines on bathroom access for transgender students and naturally he pulled the same trick here holding that the hhs rule does not build upon  sex discrimination  and is therefore unlawfulclearly this ruling was based on the ludicrous idea that religious people are being discriminated against when they are being told they can t discriminate much like the hobby lobby ruling which allowed businesses to discriminate against women by not offering birth control with their company insurance plans ironically they don t have to offer paid maternity leave or help out with any of the consequences from not having access to birth control still o connor tried to rationalize it calling insuring transgender people a  burden that fear is now an undeniable reality o connor held that treating transgender patients and even insuring transgender patients substantially burdens  insurance companies and hospitals   exercise of religion  as a result under rfra the hhs rule must be  the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest  o connor decided that the rule did not constitute  the least restrictive means  of preventing discrimination why not because  the government can assume the cost  of transgenderrelated treatment and  assist transgender individuals in finding  a doctor who will treat them the judge then goes on to suggest that protecting transgender people from discrimination isn t actually a  compelling government interest  in the first placeas for the abortion part of the ruling well doctors are not and have never been required to perform abortions this though would allow a doctor to not treat a yearold woman for let s say cancer just because she had an abortion at the most bizarre part of the ruling though had nothing to do with the law and everything to do with th century thinking the christian medical associations who brought the suit argued that treating either transgender patients or women who ve had abortions is tantamount to  material cooperation with evil  what century are we in againthis ruling though would open the doors to other types of discrimination essentially against anything a religious doctor might find yucky like treating lgbt people or the children of lgbt peoplemany will shrug their shoulders and argue that it s no big deal that the majority of doctors will still treat all patients while it s hard to say that s true right now in some parts of the country it s not that simple in many parts of the south for example it might be difficult to find a doctor who s willing to treat either a woman who s had an abortion or a transgender person funny though that doctors are still not allowed to discriminate against people born male or christiansfeatured image via joe readlegetty images',\n",

       " 'saudi oil chief khalid alfalih tells opec changes are coming  the new york times vienna  —   the new oil minister in saudi arabia the de facto leader of the opec countries had a message for the global market don’t expect us to influence the price of crude oil by adjusting supplies “i think managing in the traditional way that we tried in the past may never come again” the minister khalid   said on thursday “certainly we will not go with certain price targets ” the message  —   which came after the decision on thursday by the   organization of the petroleum exporting countries to maintain high levels of oil production  —   is central to the changing strategy of the saudi   complex and it could foreshadow a period of volatility for oil prices because opec’s policies and the saudis’ sway have long helped guide the markets in a sweeping directive in april saudi arabia set forth  plans to diversify its economy reduce its dependence on oil and pull back on its government handouts and what mr falih does with saudi arabia’s oil  —   how much the kingdom decides to pump and where the money goes  —   is the biggest piece of the puzzle the global markets received a sneak peak at thursday’s opec meeting mr falih’s first since his appointment last month as the head of an expanded energy industry and mining ministry while other opec members have been urging the freezing or lowering of oil production mr falih is pushing to keep it high and plow the money into other industries that might prove profitable for saudi arabia he wants the cartel to rethink its longstanding approach and assumptions that it can manage global oil supplies and prices it runs counter to the longtime stance of his predecessor ali   who presided over an era when opec was largely content to restrain production to try to drive prices up the saudis’ shift is easier to justify because price pressures have abated of late while oil initially dipped on thursday it recovered to around  a barrel about twice what it was in january oil producers should “let the market forces continue to seek and find that equilibrium price between supply and demand” said mr falih speaking to a small group of reporters in his penthouse hotel suite the saudis can increasingly afford to go their own way along with a wealth of oil reserves saudi arabia invested tens of billions of dollars in building a competitive oil business at a time when other opec countries like venezuela and iran allowed their industries to deteriorate mr falih has been at the core of those moves mr falih a  graduate of texas am jumped onto the international oil scene in the early s hoping to inject life and competition into the economy king abdullah saudi arabia’s ruler at the time invited overseas companies to look for natural gas after shutting them out in the s to the surprise of western oil executives the king tapped mr falih then a young executive at saudi aramco to manage complex negotiations for a series of joint ventures with royal dutch shell of britain total of france and lukoil of russia although the ventures didn’t find much gas mr falih garnered credit for deftly juggling conflicting interests “after a year or so i had to accept that he was really good at what he was doing” said floris ansingh who was the head of shell in saudi arabia at the time “he understood the different   ” mr falih’s international focus set the stage for the evolution of saudi aramco after he was named chief executive of the company in  he pushed for modernization trying to turn the   oil company into a global competitor that rivaled the private giants in the west he expanded areas like oil trading and acquisitions and tried to lock up demand by investing in china and in other growing economies saudi aramco has recently developed three giant oil fields sharply increasing the amount of oil it can produce the company earned an estimated  billion from oil production last year according to the commercial intelligence firm wood mackenzie “the view in the industry is that aramco is one of the best oil companies in the world” said j robinson west a senior adviser on energy at the center for strategic and international studies a research organization “khalid has been important in building that ” mr falih also seems unafraid to tread on sensitive ground as the head of the national oil company he warned that   domestic fuel consumption risked eroding the   exports that are the kingdom’s main source of cash “we need to make sure that we use our precious oil and gas resources efficiently wisely and minimizing waste” mr falih said at a dinner in  at the time rethinking the country’s energy use at home was a politically fraught issue government subsidies that kept fuel cheap were considered an untouchable piece of the saudi social contract and with oil prices surging back then the kingdom’s oil wealth it seemed would only grow now his warning is part of the new saudi   “he is a very astute political player” said valérie marcel author of “oil titans” a book about national oil companies “he has been able to push back and create space to debate issues while still keeping himself in good position with the ruler ” mr falih also recognized early on that growing concern for the climate could reduce demand for saudi oil creating a risk that a large portion of those resources might be left in the ground on thursday mr falih said that saudi arabia was now preparing for the worst case by moving aggressively to spur growth of   industries while he said he thought that demand for crude would last for generations mr falih added that “we as human beings cannot be complacent and assume that oil will continue to fuel the world forever ” in recent years mr falih has taken on the role of trusted confidant serving as adviser and troubleshooter for prince mohammed bin salman in  the prince put mr falih in charge of the kingdom’s troubled health ministry which was struggling to contain a deadly respiratory virus called mers in his new role mr falih has significant oversight of a huge portion of the saudi economy the oil ministry absorbed the ministry of electricity and was renamed the ministry of energy industry and mineral resources he has also been appointed head of the   mining company a   industrial fund the geological survey the atomic and renewable energy program and a number of other   economic bodies mr falih faces a huge set of objectives some in areas where his predecessor came up short despite its oil wealth the kingdom struggles to produce sufficient natural gas to meet the   needs of electricity generators and industry efforts to develop solar power and other renewable energy sources have also lagged some of saudi arabia’s neighbors like the united arab emirates mr falih is part of the plan to refocus the country’s financial firepower to invest in areas other than oil in a sign of the shifting strategy the kingdom traditionally conservative in its investment approach recently invested   billion in the     uber it was one of the largest investments into a privately held   mr falih is also in charge of the effort to sell a small stake in saudi aramco to investors with a target of  he said the idea was to make the company more global as it looks to add investments in natural gas a public listing might also improve the company’s performance “if you have to face the analysts every quarter” he said “it gives you a bit of competitive tension ” to make it all work mr falih will have to persuade the country’s stubborn constituents to adopt a

       " 'homeschoolers revolt against republican school choice bill  breitbart homeschooling families throughout the nation are voicing opposition to a   school choice bill that they say will ultimately result in regulation of homeschooling in the united states many parents who homeschool their children as well as their numerous local and national homeschooling organizations are protesting the bill introduced by iowa rep steve king r and calling upon the members of congress who are its sponsors to “leave homeschooling families alone ”  school vouchers created by h r  the choices in education act of  “would be a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling” asserts william estrada director of federal relations for the home school legal defense association hslda king’s bill would first repeal the elementary and secondary education act esea of  while many homeschoolers agree with the repeal of esea the bill next would send all federal education funds to the states in the form of grants which states would then distribute as vouchers to public private and homeschooled students estrada asserts the bill would essentially create a “federal right to homeschool ” section  of the bill states “to be eligible to receive a grant  …    the state will  …    make it lawful for parents of an eligible child to elect  …    to enroll their child in any public or private elementary or secondary school in the state or to   their child ” estrada explains while this sounds good hslda has fought  —   successfully —  for decades to make sure that there is no “federal right to homeschool” because what could be created by a favorable congress could be regulated by a future hostile congress it is far better and far more constitutionally sound for education decisions —  and homeschool freedom —  to be protected at the state level we ask our friends at the federal level to simply leave homeschooling families alone section  of the bill further states the state shall distribute funds  …    based on the number of eligible children enrolled in the public schools operated by each local educational agency and the number of eligible children within each local educational agency’s geographical area whose parents elect to send their child to a private school or to   their child   …     on an annual basis on a date to be determined by the secretary each local education agency shall inform the state educational agency of  …    the number of eligible children within each local educational agency’s geographical area whose parents elect  …    to   their child estrada says the bill allows states to “track” homeschooling students “there is only one way that states and school districts can do this by requiring homeschooling families to register with them and be tracked by the school district” he asserts “this will be especially problematic in states that do not require homeschooling families to file a notice of intent with the local school district h r  will require homeschooling families in all  states to register with the local school district this would be just the first cost of ‘free government money ’” in a statement on his website about the bill king says in order to receive a grant or voucher under my legislation the state must ensure that the funds be distributed appropriately on a per pupil basis additionally and most importantly this bill makes it lawful for the parent to make the ultimate decision between public private or   education for their children however estrada asserts it is not the job of the federal government to grant parents the freedom to decide their children’s education “the constitution protects the right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children as the u s supreme court has ruled in its seminal cases of meyer pierce and yoder” he says “federal legislation to ‘protect’ homeschooling is unnecessary ” in an interview with breitbart news king says he “regrets” most of all that a    meeting has not taken place with homeschooling parents prior to the uproar over his bill the iowa congressman says that while his legislative director has been on the phone with homeschoolers opposed to his legislation a meeting he had slated with them may have been canceled due to his schedule he said he and his staff have asked homeschoolers to hold back on their open criticism of the bill until he could meet with them “and now we’ve got a national thing going on here that didn’t need to happen” king says “i’ve been trying for the last several weeks to have a meeting with them and i’ve said to my staff i want to look them in the eye and i want to talk this through reasonably ” “i’ve tried to talk openly and do business and we haven’t been able to have that meeting and i regret that” king emphasizes still adding that he is surprised “there’s a nationwide effort to oppose the broadest most sweeping bill that supports parents being in charge of their children’s education that this congress has ever seen ” he explains his view of the legislation the objective is this that we’re watching as a nationwide curriculum is being established and that nationwide curriculum coupled with the money that goes to that pushes all the public schools into that system and eventually drags the parochial schools into that curriculum i’m watching as our   values are being undermined and i’m watching as western civilization is being deconstructed systemically throughout our public school system and especially in our universities  —   which we don’t touch with this by the way the object is to put parents back in control of their children’s education and curriculum and put it in a position where the public schools compete with the parochial schools to have exempted homeschools from this would have made the bill the target of homeschoolers too king thinks homeschoolers should participate in his bill for the sake of the new system  —   the intention of which he says is to save the culture of the country that is being destroyed by the public school monopoly he continues they’re missing the objective of this bill which is to put the public schools in a position where they have to compete with the parochial schools and respect and honor the homeschools and let the states regulate those things at that level not the federal government states that are unwilling to pass a voucher program have to give up their federal money so isn’t that a much bigger goal for us  —   to put the public schools into competition with parochial schools than it is to preserve the status quo of homeschool homeschoolers king argues want “to be protected from ever being threatened by a state approving federal funds going through a voucher system that might tempt some of their people to accept some money that comes from the state and federal government ” “to do that they would not want to have parochial schools have an opportunity to compete with the public schools which takes down our ability to allow masses of parents to decide curriculums moral values etc ” he continues “many parents can’t afford to send their children to a parochial school nor can they actually homeschool their children ” wisconsin homeschooling parent tina hollenbeck however writes at her blog about the level of regulation king’s bill is inviting in for homeschoolers the measure she says provides for states to be “mandated to send information about all children  —   yes every child using any form of education  —   to the federal secretary of education in order to get the voucher money h r  claims the states are due ” hollenbeck continues of course the states will want to report on all the children anyway  —   more children equals more money for state coffers even if some of us don’t take it  —   but even if a state wanted to behave ethically in order to protect the privacy of home educators who refuse voucher money they are not allowed to do so under this bill thus any state that currently requires any sort of notification from homeschoolers  —   information that previously remained at the local or state level  —   will now violate our privacy by giving information about us to the federal secretary of education  —   without regard to either the th or th amendments to the constitution and we can expect swift   action from states whose homeschool laws currently require no   they will assert that they “must” know who the homeschooled children are according to h r   …     karen braun a homeschooling parent from michigan also tells breitbart news she is opposed to h r  “reading the fine print it is clear they will make sure that states distribute the funds in a manner so as to ‘ensure that such payments will be used for appropriate educational expenses’” she explains “and who gets to define ‘appropriate educational expense’ they do ” “this isn’t about giving homeschoolers help or offering choices but about giving the nanny state more control” braun concludes the bill is   by republican reps andy harris md trent franks az and pete olson tx estrada observes to members of hslda that franks has clarified his position on the bill after speaking with homeschoolers we talked with franks and his staff and they agree with our concerns about homeschooling families being included in h r  as a result there is no need to contact his office and we are deeply grateful to him for his commitment to protecting homeschool freedom from “help” by the federal government here is the statement franks gave us “i understand the concerns of the homeschool community my support for the bill only extends to vouchers for public school and private school students if this bill moves forward i would request that any language that would impose vouchers upon homeschools is taken out ” breitbart news reached out to franks’ office and his staff confirmed his statement to estrada the bill is introduced just as betsy devos takes her post as u s education secretary devos  —   whose primary areas of interest have been school choice and school voucher programs  —   experienced unprecedented controversy during her confirmation process from both those on the left who fear privatization of public schools and those on the right who have warned against regulation of private and home schools through vouchers the school voucher  —   as a transfer of taxpayer funds  —   is a finance mechanism to create school choice and one that is associated with the highest level of regulation for schools that agree to accept them if parents use vouchers to send their children to a private school or to homeschool them that school choice may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located  —   in the name of “accountability ” in a  study at cato institute andrew coulson studied the question of school vouchers and increased regulation of private schools he concluded that “vouchers  …     impose a substantial and statistically significant additional regulatory burden on participating private schools ” voucher programs coulson concluded are more likely to “suffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access” because state funds —  which invariably come with state regulation —  are directly transferred in the form of vouchers to parents to spend in an alternate education setting cindy nicolai writes at the   constitutional home educators alliance that for homeschoolers government regulations are binding “strings ” “  and   home education must avoid those strings in order to retain our independence sovereignty autonomy and most importantly our freedom” she explains “we recognize the value of that freedom and are willing to pay the cost to keep   home education unrestricted and free from government control ” “homeschools are not threatened under this bill” king insists but adds “i’m still open to listen to viewpoints but they also must listen to mine and they have not done that they should come and talk to me in a reasonable fashion instead of unleashing letters across the state and asking people to send tweets at me send letters and call my office ”',\n",
       " 'could teaching men to nurture counteract our culture of toxic masculinity by ann deslandes  thevocalcomau \\nthe feminist and feministadjacent internet had a mild implosion in february in response to an article by canadian organiser writer and college professor nora samaran a pseudonym titled ‘the opposite of rape culture is nurturance culture’  samaran proposes that the solution to rape culture and other manifestations of gendered abuse lies in the inverse of violence which she says is nurturance – that isa deep capacity to create safety and trust that many men are not permitted to develop in patriarchal culture patriarchal masculinity as samaran observes teaches men that healthy attachment needs such as attunement comfort and responsiveness or emotional availability are weak and wrong as such men become “less able to experience women as whole beings” and are “less able to make sense of their own needs” so as samaran argues if men can work together to connect with their capacity to nurture and teach each other the skills and qualities of “healthy attachment” violence against women and nonbinary folks might be turned around to its opposite nurturance \\nas a proposed

concerned with no less than the deep structural transformation of heteropatriarchal gendered culture \\nwhen i interviewed samaran via skype last month she suggested that the length and depth of the piece might actually be the reason it had such an impact in her words “the piece seems to have resonated so deeply because it combines current knowledge about the brain and nervous system with an analysis of power” and she observes this kind of thinking is becoming quietly more common “it seems to me that for those who are paying attention we are shifting away from cultures of dominance while on the surface we live in very violent times and so much seems so hopeless underneath there is a kind of tapping into a vast and deep reservoir of purpose and hope when you begin to pay attention you feel and see it emerging on many different fronts seemingly simultaneously even in very traditional places this change is happening we see it in climate scientists beginning to legitimise considering feelings as important sources of information  or the field of medicine beginning to grapple with the possibility of a shared consciousness  it’s happening in so many very significant places seemingly independently such as black lives matter  indigenous resurgence happening across turtle island  the radical mental health movement in work such as the icarus project … so much is arising against different forms of dominance simultaneously and it feels like rigid masculinity is one of those forms and is connected to all the others” \\nas nurturance culture gained traction samaran began inviting people to submit their own descriptions of what the “nurturance” she is proposing looks like which resulted in dozens of stories of husbands boyfriends lovers friends brothers and fathers showing the kind of dependable love and intimate care that is indeed the opposite of hurting hitting bashing and raping this included responses from men keen to share their understanding of the skills of nurturance such as this one \\n“for at least a little while especially when someone you are with is in need of nurture let go of your own needs and desires what does that mean it means stop thinking about anything related to yourself how you feel what you need what you think is best just listen and listen very closely try to imagine what it must be like to be this other person absorb everything you know about their history and experiences and try to embody these listen to what they are saying and repeat it back to them in order to clarify whether or not you’ve actually absorbed the essential meaning of what they are communicating to you” \\nresponses like this reflects one of samaran’s intentions for the piece – in her words “for men to teach one another what they are currently learning individually from women about how to be nurturing” samaran notes there were unforeseen responses too such as those who “interpreted the piece to mean that men should love and nurture and bond with one another ”  on the one hand “men connecting more with other men in a way that skips nurturing women entirely is not really my goal… i’ve even seen allmale panels on masculine nurturance culture” she laughs still she adds “i think this piece cracked open an existing profound desire among men to be able to get closer to one another and that is beautiful – men want to love each other to nurture each other and they don’t feel allowed that’s one of the big things i hear is being discussed when this piece is used in workshops and discussion groups and conference panels i just hope they do it in ways that grow their love and capacity to be nurturing to the women and nonbinary folks in their lives – not just to strengthen masculine bonds” moreover the answer to the question ‘nurturance is…’ must amount to something more than just ‘not raping or assaulting’ samaran adds “i’m saying that “nurturance is about learning how to make someone feel safe i’m saying that it is totally ok to be honest and speak without shame of what we do and don’t know but social scripts about masculinity put a lot of pressure on men to never admit when they don’t know something it’s completely ok to say ‘hey i don’t know how to be a safe man a safe male presence in women’s lives’– because that is about a lot more than just not raping it is about creating safe connection and spaces in which women and nonbinary folks can heal from the massive gendered violence we experience and it is about recognising that men need to do this work and teach it to each other because we are already so exhausted from doing it” \\naccording to samaran another critical aspect of nurturance culture that people have responded to is its discussion of shame “on the surface the shame over not being able to provide what someone needs is massive and apparently that’s a big thing for men however underneath there is a complex operation of shame going on in masculinity if you have shamed yourself for having perfectly normal needs you may not realise that you are doing so and instead may perceive those same needs as shameful when they appear in other people you may then actively shame people when they express those same normal needs you have internalised as shameful for yourself so let’s say you learned very early on that needing to be held tenderly and gazed upon lovingly is shameful you put it away and can’t access it or even remember it when someone you are lovers with has that very normal and healthy need instead of comforting her appropriately you may treat her as shameful and confusing or become angry and withdrawn and then blame her for this tension by calling her ‘needy’ or ‘unreasonable’– when really it is your own denied need that you are seeing if you can recognise nurturance needs as completely normal and healthy you can get your own denied needs met and also respond in a good way to the needs of a lover partner or close friend ironically guilt and shame can be paralysing and can prevent emotional maturity from emerging we really do need to understand how to work to reduce shame and guilt and increase our culture’s ability to let people be vulnerable i’m interested in how we create a culture that is safe enough that vulnerability and being completely accepted as our whole selves is taken as a matter of course as a strength as a normal part of daily life not just in our families but in our society across the board that is how we will move away from shame and guilt and towards accountability and love” \\nconsidering australia’s current crisis of violence against women i asked samaran about the role of public governmentsponsored campaigns like ‘the line’ aimed at raising awareness amongst young people about consent and the impact of intimate partner violence and the rollout of relationships education in schools where students learn about respectful relationships can measures like this complement or help build a nurturance culture “sure” she replied “mainstream media and the education system are both central in raising young people so these programs are helpful still programs like the ones you describe are not enough – they’re not a replacement for the daily intimate work of building a culture that does the opposite of harm programs like this are resources but let’s not overlook where the learning really comes from – it is deep cultural change we need and schools can be slow to change” in this vein samaran also encourages readers to consider characters and plots that demonstrate nurturance in popular culture and in existing social movements primarily led by black and indigenous people of colour who are creating the world we want to see “when thinking about huge social problems like men’s violence it’s so important to think about what the world we want could look like and where it already looks more like what we want” \\nann deslandes is a freelance writer and researcher tweet her at

       " '‘i’ve become a racist’ migrant wave unleashes danish tensions over identity  the new york times taarnby denmark  —   johnny christensen a stout and   retired bank employee always thought of himself as sympathetic to people fleeing war and welcoming to immigrants but after more than   mostly muslim asylum seekers poured into denmark over the past two years mr christensen  said “i’ve become a racist ” he believes these new migrants are draining denmark’s cherished   system but failing to adapt to its customs “just kick them out” he said unleashing a mighty kick at an imaginary target on a suburban sidewalk “these muslims want to keep their own culture but we have our own rules here and everyone must follow them ” denmark a small and orderly nation with a progressive   is built on a social covenant in return for some of the world’s highest wages and benefits people are expected to work hard and pay into the system newcomers must quickly learn danish  —   and adapt to norms like keeping tidy gardens and riding bicycles the country had little experience with immigrants until  when the first “guest workers” were invited from turkey pakistan and what was then yugoslavia its   million people remain overwhelmingly native born though the percentage has dropped to  today from  in  bo lidegaard a prominent historian said many danes feel strongly that “we are a multiethnic society today and we have to realize it  —   but we are not and should never become a multicultural society ” the recent influx pales next to the one million migrants absorbed into germany or the   into sweden last year but the pace shocked this stable homogeneous country the   government has backed harsh measures targeting migrants hate speech has spiked and the   danish people’s party is now the second largest in parliament some of the same hostilities were reflected this weekend in germany where voters in chancellor angela merkel’s home state embraced   candidates  —   an emphatic rejection of her refugee policy there is new tension between danes still opening their arms and a resurgent right wing that seeks to ban all muslims and shut denmark off from europe mr christensen the retired banker supports emerging proposals for his country to follow britain in exiting the european union there is tension too over whether the backlash is really about a strain on denmark’s generous public benefits or a rising terrorist threat  —   or whether a longstanding but latent racial hostility is being unearthed analysts say that the public voiced little opposition after   poles and   americans among other westerners emigrated to denmark in  but that there has been significant criticism of the nearly   syrian asylum seekers who arrived that year and the next they and other migrants were not invited and many ended up here by accident intercepted on their route to sweden critics complain that these newcomers have been slow to learn danish  —   though the immigration ministry recently reported that  percent passed a required language exam some danes bristle at what they see as ethnic enclaves about  percent of new immigrants lived in the nation’s two largest cities aarhus and copenhagen where muslim women in abayas and men in prayer caps stand out among the blond and   crowds on narrow streets perhaps the leading  —   and most substantive  —   concern is that the migrants are an economic drain in   percent of immigrants from   countries ages  to  were employed compared with  percent of native danes the immigration ministry has sought to avoid what it calls “parallel societies” of migrants living in “vicious circles of bad image social problems and a high rate of unemployment ” tightened immigration requirements the ministry said in its latest annual report weed out those “who have weaker capabilities for being able to integrate into danish society ” omar mahmoud  an iraqi engineer who entered denmark a year ago and lives in a refugee center in randers a city of   is trying his best to fit in he and his wife are taking danish classes and their three children are learning the language and making danish friends in school they are muslim but attend church to learn about christianity and he said he was not opposed to his son’s eating pork a staple of the danish diet though it is forbidden in islam mr mahmoud said his family had not encountered direct insults or threats but was frightened by the   and   tenor in the public discourse “it’s like foreigners are put in a special clan separate from the danish people” he lamented still mr mahmoud said that “some of the danish people are angels” and that he was relieved to be far from the violence of iraq “i’m in my heaven now ” anders   a   city councilman in randers said the influx had forced a more honest conversation about national identity “our problem in denmark is that we’ve been too polite” he said “no one dared talk about” immigration he added “because they were afraid they’d be called racist ” denmark is just one of many european nations grappling with the wave of migrants amid a spate of terrorist attacks across the continent by islamic extremists a recent pew research center survey found that at least half the citizens in eight of  countries polled said incoming refugees increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks the confluence of these and other factors has prompted a   of the postwar promise of a unified borderless europe macedonia hungary and slovenia have all built border fences denmark imposed new identity controls on its border with germany in january and for the first time since  sweden requires entering danes to show identity papers many analysts saw britain’s surprise vote to leave the european union as an angry expression of concern that british  —   or especially english  —   identity was being diluted by the nation’s growing diversity debate is raging anew over whether certain islamic modes of dress  —     swimsuits known as burkinis in france and face veils in germany  —   inherently contravene countries’ values similar themes are seen as underpinning a wave of new measures here in denmark the government has made its citizenship test more difficult and slashed by nearly half a package of integration benefits a measure passed in january though rarely enforced empowers the authorities to confiscate valuables from new arrivals to offset the cost of settling them last year denmark placed ads in   newspapers stressing its tough new policies essentially suggesting don’t come here muslims do not assimilate as easily as europeans or some asians said denmark’s culture minister bertel haarder partly because as he put it their patriarchal culture frowns on women working outside the home and often constrains freedom of speech “it’s not racism to be aware of the difference  —   it’s stupid not to be aware” mr haarder said “we do them a blessing by being very clear and outspoken as to what kind of country they have come to what are our basic values ” but much of the difference remains unspoken this is a country where pedestrians wait for a green light to cross even when no cars are in sight a contrast to the bustling streets of middle eastern capitals birgitte romme larsen a danish anthropologist who has studied refugees and asylum seekers in rural areas mentioned an african refugee who did not realize that closing his curtains during the day was interpreted as being unduly secretive other newcomers were not aware that congregating and talking loudly at a grocery might offend danish sensibilities “these implicit expectations cannot be written into an integration folder” migrants receive ms larsen said sherif sulaiman an organic food scientist who moved to denmark eight years ago from egypt said muslims must not close themselves off in enclaves but open themselves up for interaction he is the manager of an islamic center that opened in  and invites danes in for meals and for an annual “harmony week ” mr sulaiman pushed to have the mosque complex use scandinavian architectural style and furniture and lends its conference room to a church for meetings “we should be like this glass  —   transparent” he said pointing to a window “as long as we follow the rules of the country we are part of danish society ” but some   immigrants who have lived in denmark for decades say assimilation seems an elusive and   target patricia bandak and her brother sylvester bbaale came to denmark from uganda as babies in  like their native neighbors they are polite and punctual and ride their bicycles everywhere the siblings are not muslim but said they frequently encountered racism in school they were called the n word and told that they should stop eating ugandan food like matoke a starchy fruit mr bbaale  who operates a food truck said he was beaten on the street last year by three men who cursed at him and told him to go back to africa “for a lot of people being danish is in your blood so i will never be danish” said ms bandak  who became a danish citizen in  and is studying documentary film “i call myself a dane of a different color ” then there is ozlem cekic a   muslim who served as a leftist member of parliament from  to  her three children were born in denmark she wrote a  memoir in danish and she said “i even dream in danish ” yet mrs cekic  said she often received death threats and heard shouts of “go home” on the street every time terrorists strike europe she is bombarded by hundreds of hate messages lately people have inundated her with accusations that muslims are milking the welfare system and plotting against danes while in parliament mrs cekic held “dialogue coffees” at which she would explain  —   in fluent danish  —   why she is as danish as anyone “they meet me for coffee and suddenly they say their problem isn’t with me but with those other people” she recalled “i tell them ‘i am the other ’” karin andersen is one of thousands of danes trying to help the immigrants settle through groups formed on facebook called venligboerne or kind citizens she spends several days each month with housam mohammed shamden  his wife and two daughters who fled syria in  and now live in randers with small danish flags taped to the front door of their apartment and tucked into flower vases “danes are so concerned about losing their culture” said ms andersen  a retired teacher “but how many help the ones who want to be part of it” however many they are often drowned out by reports of muslims being spat at and showered with racist slurs in may two danes ripped the head scarves off two girls the month before a national controversy erupted after a public swimming pool in copenhagen created   lessons in response to muslim requests “freedom of speech is now interpreted as freedom to say anything hateful” said julie jeeg a law student who volunteers with an antiracism group “denmark is closing in on itself people are retreating inward ” witness the “meatball war ” in january after revelations that a randers day care center had stopped serving pork meatballs since its muslim students would not eat them the town council narrowly passed a measure requiring that pork be served “on equal terms with other kinds of food ” the councilman who pushed the measure frank noergaard of the danish people’s party said he was incensed that “pork could be abandoned in denmark” adding “if you give in on pork what’s next”',\n",

       " 'tips for keeping that postvacation feeling  the new york times a colleague recently returned from a trip to europe with that unmistakable     glow striving to hold on to it for as long as possible she deployed various strategies including placing her used boarding passes front and center on her desk and leaving receipts from the tv tower in berlin and the eiffel tower in paris on a bedroom chest of drawers that she passes each morning “it just surrounds me” she said of the strategic placement of her vacation mementos “it sustains that warm vibe ” she also made a point of incorporating items that she bought during her trip into her daily life back in new york in berlin for instance she picked up a silver bodum milk frother with the idea that when she returned home she would make her coffee the way a friend made it for her each morning in berlin yes she could have bought a bodum frother in new york but hers is imbued with meaning because she purchased it in berlin where her friend bought hers wearing clothes acquired on vacation also helps she said especially if you first wore that new dress to a jazz club or while strolling from the latin quarter to the marais “it brings back the memories” she said “because you’re wearing the memories ” i liked her strategies and began wondering about other potential   tactics a number of studies suggest that much pleasure can be derived from actively anticipating a vacation looking at photos of the places you plan to visit reading about the culture making dinner reservations or simply imagining yourself enjoying your time there maintaining pleasure after a great vacation is more challenging researchers have found that the glow if achieved at all fades quickly indeed one such study published in  in applied research in quality of life surveyed   dutch individuals and noted that only vacationers who said they had a “very relaxed” trip benefited in terms of   happiness and even among that group the   high lasted a mere two weeks or so one possible reason that travelers have an easier time anticipating a vacation than hanging on to its afterglow is that in general anticipation evokes stronger feelings and images research published in the journal of experimental psychology in  by leaf van boven at the university of colorado at boulder and laurence ashworth at queen’s university in kingston ontario found that “the tendency to report more intense emotions during anticipation than during retrospection is robust and pervasive in everyday life ” even so all is not necessarily lost the moment you step off the plane there are some things you can do before you travel and when you return home that may help keep you in a holiday state of mind  plan make sure that your vacation is likely to provide you with happy memories by nailing down in advance the kind of details that can trip you up which bus to take into the city what hours the museum is open   vacations lower stress according to research by shawn achor a former lecturer at harvard known for his talks on positive psychology and the founder of good think a consulting firm in cambridge mass along with michelle gielan founder of the institute for applied positive research “poorly planned and stressful vacations eliminate the positive benefit of time away” mr achor wrote in a blog series for the harvard business review last year “a positive   vacation can make you happier and less stressed and you can return with more energy at work and with more meaning in your life ”  reminisce most people snap back to their particular baseline level of happiness shortly after returning from a vacation but psychologists say that reminiscing about a trip even long after it’s over can bring deep pleasure in the present “flipping through a photo album or watching old video clips us at the grand canyon me driving my motorbike helps us relive the positive experience and the positive feelings we had at the time” writes sonja lyubomirsky a psychology professor at the university of california riverside in “the myths of happiness ” this can also be accomplished she and others have said by savoring the details of a trip the smell of jasmine in the park the sound of the orchestra in the amphitheater and sharing them with others “rather than letting our   possessions and experiences to gather dust on shelves and in closets and memories” dr lyubomirsky wrote “we can either literally   them in the present e g by taking out the faded trivial pursuit or metaphorically e g by reminiscing about spring break ”  retreat “nowhere is there a more idyllic spot a vacation home more private and peaceful than in one’s own mind especially when it is furnished in such a way that the merest inward glance induces ease” wrote the roman emperor marcus aurelius in a translation of his “meditations” by c scot hicks and david v hicks “take this vacation as often as you like” he continued “and so charge your spirit ” knowing i was in the market for   preservatives another colleague shared with me that passage which seems as relevant in the s as it was in the s the importance of vacation has been explored in various studies including one published in the journal society and mental health in  the authors including terry hartig a professor in the department of psychology at uppsala university sweden looked into whether the potential benefits of vacationing having more energy fewer health complaints better life satisfaction could spread among individuals contributing “more to population health than the sum of benefits to individual workers ” using data from a pharmacy corporation allied with sweden’s national health care system and from governmental sources they found that the dispensation of antidepressants declined with an increase in the number of vacationing workers ideally vast swaths of the population would take time off simultaneously for what the researchers call “collective restoration ” however the researchers also found that having a good vacation may not only benefit you it may also benefit others those good feelings you return with can spread to your colleagues even though they themselves didn’t take a vacation so consider encouraging your   to tack those postcards to her cubicle wall or wear that new bangle from santorini who knows the happier she is after her vacation the happier you may be too',\n",

israelmatthew continetti of the washington free beacon wrote the best article on trump s bold decision to move the us embassy to jerusalem that we have seen to datenot only is president trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and begin the process of moving the us embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency it is one of the boldest moves any us president has made since the beginning of the oslo  peace process  in  that process collapsed at camp david in  when yasir arafat rejected president clinton s offer of a palestinian state and the process has been moribund ever since despite multiple attempts to restart itthat is why the warnings from trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow there is no peace process to wreck the conflict is frozen and the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in us or israeli policy but in palestinian autocracy corruption and incitement have the former obama administration officials decrying trump s announcement read a newspaper lately from listening to them you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the middle east but for trump in fact the region is engulfed in war terrorism poverty and despotism israel faces threats in the north and south its sworn enemy iran is growing in influence and reach and the delegitimization of the jewish state proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses i forget how the obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world maybe someone will remind meone of the reasons the middle east persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been for decades a playground of magical thinking whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the ayatollah khamenei is a goodfaith partner whether it is imagining that assad will go just because we tell him to or that isis is akin to a terrorist  jv team  liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the middle east that is much more flattering than the actuality a similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over jerusalem every israeli knows jerusalem was is and will remain his capital every recent president has agreed with him and the us consensus has been bipartisan the last four democratic platforms have said the obvious that jerusalem is israel s capital the senate voted  only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote was it all virtuesignaling a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of us diplomacyit is a sign of the disingenuousness of american foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning president trump has no background in or admiration for the routines manners and norms of the us foreign service especially that part of it which specializes in the israelipalestinian conflict this has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid jerusalem is israel s capital full stop his transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition in march  at the aipac policy conference he pledged that  we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people jerusalem  his remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the proisrael communityi wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of us law as  disruptive  have they not paid attention to this man donald trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the us capital for decades in this sense his jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm he is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion what trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one by keeping his campaign promise today he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the united states could have its cake and eat it too on the question of israel s capital and by moving our embassy to jerusalem the united states will acknowledge israel s right to determine its own capital city that is not something to condemn or fear it is something to be proud of',\n",

       " 'an nfl executive honoring his lost sister speaks out about anorexia  the new york times san francisco  —   paraag marathe’s structured analytical mind has served him well in the offices of silicon valley and the national football league he figured that he could lean on those traits the first time he spoke publicly about his sister shilpa and how anorexia had taken her life but composure failed marathe in  six years after shilpa’s death while he spoke to survivors and grieving family members at an event for andrea’s voice a nonprofit foundation that tries to promote education about eating disorders and their treatments “not only did i break down a little bit during that speech” said marathe  the san francisco ers’ chief strategy officer and executive vice president for football operations “it was also one of those weird moments afterwards i emotionally collapsed in the arms of somebody there who had lost her daughter ” the memories were back marathe had watched his brilliant sister succumb to   thoughts and starve herself he had seen shilpa wither to less than  pounds in the last years of her life had felt the shame and puzzlement that her condition brought to his family fueled by regret  —   why had he not noticed sooner and why wasn’t he more assertive in trying to help shilpa  —   marathe has found his voice he will patiently tell you that  million americans are believed to suffer from eating disorders and that medical insurance plans rarely cover treatment of the condition he will remind you that anorexia has the highest fatality rate among mental illnesses  —   about  percent according to a    published in archives of general psychiatry and cited by the national institute of mental health   caregivers and advocates welcome marathe’s help in shattering the myth that anorexia afflicts only    white girls and women the illness claims men too and frequently remains a taboo subject in less affluent or nonwhite families said kristina saffran of project heal an organization that raises money to cover care from diagnosis to recovery “he told me ‘i’m your perfect spokesman i’m a male i’m a minority and i’m in football’ ” saffran said paraag and shilpa grew up in saratoga calif a prosperous bedroom community southwest of san jose they were the children of successful indian immigrants paraag three years younger was gregarious and smart but drawn more to wiffle ball and nerf football than homework shilpa was bookish and introverted a   student she hated sports she also had compulsive idiosyncrasies shilpa insisted on eating her meals at the same time every day her brother said after dinner each night she would walk around the house for half an hour listening to her sony walkman marathe said he thinks now that shilpa was showing signs of mental illness as far back as junior high school at the time just a child himself he dismissed the signs as typical of his “weird sister ” by the time shilpa graduated from law school at u c l a magna cum laude of course she was down to  pounds marathe said he remembers that firms eagerly invited her for job interviews after reading the incisive legal papers she wrote but no one would hire her after seeing her in person shilpa spent her final  years living with her parents she died at  in march  it took marathe years to emerge from a cocoon of secrecy he had friends who never met shilpa that included his wife jennifer who marathe said became his best friend when they were at the university of california berkeley in retrospect he sees his own vanity “i was a kid” marathe said “i was in my early s and i used to convince myself that i was just a protective little brother when i saw other people looking at my sister the way they did when in reality the truth was that i was embarrassed by being seen with her so i could never take her to a coffee shop or a movie i used to be jealous of my cousins who would be able to do that ” marathe is now on the board of directors for andrea’s voice and he has supported other similar organizations in northern california like the eating disorder resource center and the monterey institute of mental health but there is one place where marathe has not dared to tread he still has not found a way to discuss shilpa’s deterioration in any detail with their parents or invited them to hear him speak about it he recognizes deep sacrifices they made for shilpa their father quit his job as an engineer at   to help care for her and carried her to bed when she became too weak to climb the stairs his mother changed shilpa’s diapers and dutifully steamed broccoli for her the family spent huge sums of money on her treatment including what marathe estimates were  trips to the emergency room or intensive care unit and later hospice care through all of that he said he never heard his parents talk openly about what was happening to their family and he hasn’t figured out how to break the silence “immigrant families are particularly susceptible because of the whole tiger mother tiger father concept” marathe said “you don’t talk about your feelings there’s no such thing as mental illness you don’t want to bring shame on the family by being put in an inpatient facility ” marathe hopes to talk with his parents soon so he can share his growing understanding of shilpa’s illness what he has learned as well as the help he tries to offer brings him some comfort marathe’s th year with the ers has been bumpy he lost the title of team president in february the organization called it a restructuring but it was largely reported as a demotion for marathe the ers have been dreadful on the field and the fan base has grown rebellious with management coming to terms with his sister’s death however has kept professional disappointment in perspective he and his wife have a young daughter juniper a few months ago just before her first birthday juniper was standing on her own and clearly ready to walk but she couldn’t muster the courage to take that first step as he watched her something clicked for marathe “i want to do everything i can to help her develop   or ” he said “my sister didn’t have that she felt worthless ” marathe knows that his words alone won’t erase the despair of anorexia but they’re a powerful first step',\n",

of sciences said in announcing the prize “in terms of development the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the s when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels unaware that they would lead to electric trains washing machines fans and food processors” the academy said the three scientists  —     sauvage j fraser stoddart and bernard l feringa  —   will share equally in the prize of  million swedish kronor or about   nanotechnology  —   the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer or a billionth of a meter  —   has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades now scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair “they’ve got it started” said donna j nelson a professor of chemistry at the university of oklahoma and president of the american chemical society “this is just the beginning ” the first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts but how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring dr sauvage figured that out in  a charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings he found once the rings were connected the copper ion could be removed these molecules became known as catenanes the pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically like links in a chain rather than the usual chemical bonds dr stoddart made the next advance in  instead of two interlocking rings dr stoddart then at the university of birmingham in britain and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle the ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell like a bead on an abacus dr stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus as well as other complex devices one was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise   billionths of a meter a molecular elevator rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle he found as a sidelight dr sauvage and dr stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots dr stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in celtic art dr feringa in  became the first person to develop a molecular motor creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction the first motor

molecular machines that ferry materials around cells construct proteins and divide cells artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison but scientists can already envision applications in the future “think about nanomachines microrobots” said dr feringa who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in stockholm at the prize announcement “think about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs for instance ” the technology could also lead to the creation of “smart

netherlands and received his ph d in  from the university of groningen where he is a professor of organic chemistry dr feringa said he was “a bit shocked” when he got the phone call telling him he had received the nobel “i feel a little bit like the wright brothers who were flying  years ago for the first time” he said “people were saying ‘why do we need a flying machine’ and now we have a boeing  and an airbus ” the molecular discovery “opens up a whole new world of nanomachines” he said while acknowledging that as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously “we have to think about how we can handle these things safely ” dr stoddart’s name had been mentioned for the nobel for years “it really got to the point where i didn’t take it very seriously” he said he was asleep when the phone rang at  a m “i detected a swedish accent and i thought it was probably not a prank” dr stoddart said when told that he was sharing the prize with dr sauvage and dr feringa “i was totally delighted because these are my scientific brothers in many ways” he said james m tour a professor of chemistry at rice university in houston said the nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future “no one is making money on these right now but it will come” he said “these men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way ” dr tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs

spurred the united states and britain on tuesday to bar passengers from airports in a total of    countries from carrying laptop computers ipads and other devices larger than a cellphone aboard direct inbound flights two senior american counterterrorism officials said two additional american officials said the explosives were designed to be hidden in laptop batteries all four spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to publicly discuss the sensitive information the trump administration maintained that the new restrictions did not signal a credible specific threat of an imminent attack officials said the alert reflects concerns that the islamic state is ready  —   or soon will be  —   to launch new capabilities against the west sean spicer the white house press secretary declined to address the intelligence during a news media briefing on tuesday officials said passengers still could carry cellphones and other small devices into the airplane’s cabin while larger items like laptops would have to be stowed with checked luggage in all airports in  countries stretching from north africa to the mideast and into turkey are affected by the new restrictions both the united states and britain have imposed the ban on flights from some airports in egypt jordan saudi arabia and turkey washington also has restricted some flights from kuwait morocco qatar and the united arab emirates london meanwhile has additionally restricted flights from some airports in lebanon and tunisia the targeting of a jetliner using explosives shows how the islamic state which has long worked to inspire terrorist attacks is trying to compete with groups like al qaeda’s affiliate in yemen the qaeda affiliate has spent years inventing explosives that are difficult to detect including trying to disguise bombs in devices like cellphones now american intelligence officials believe the islamic state has also developed explosives that can be hidden in electronic devices one of the senior counterterror officials said representative peter king republican of new york who sits on the house intelligence and homeland security committees said that government officials had called him on saturday to alert him to the impending ban “it was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent” mr king said in a telephone interview “intelligence of something possibly planned ” the department of homeland security said the restricted items on flights to the united states included laptop computers tablets cameras travel printers and games bigger than a phone the restrictions would not apply to aircraft crews officials said in a briefing to reporters to outline the terms of the ban the american ban on electronics applies only to flights on foreign carriers it does not affect   airlines since they do not fly directly to the united states from  designated airports in eight countries  —   amman jordan cairo istanbul jidda and riyadh in saudi arabia kuwait city casablanca morocco doha qatar and dubai and abu dhabi in the united arab emirates officials did not say how long the ban would remain in place or if other airports would be added in all an estimated  flights each day into the united states would be affected one of the world’s busiest airports in abu dhabi already requires   passengers to undergo strict screening by united states customs officials before boarding flights abu dhabi is one of  airports in the world to employ the homeland security preclearance techniques several hours after the american action the british government announced its own ban on electronic devices on flights the british ban affects domestic and foreign airlines including british airways the country’s largest foreign airlines affected by the order include turkish airlines egyptair and royal jordanian among others and it affects direct flights to the united kingdom from turkey lebanon jordan egypt tunisia and saudi arabia a british official said the u k ban resulted from the combination of an evolving threat picture and a proliferation of electronic devices that airline passengers carry on board examples of attacks by extremist groups against transportation hubs over the past two years include the october  bombing of an airliner in egypt the attempted airliner downing in somalia last year and armed attacks against airports in brussels and istanbul in  the new bans on electronic devices have prompted a round of protests from passengers who now face the prospect of flying long hours without the use of laptops or tablets banu akdenizli an associate professor of communication at northwestern university’s campus in doha complained that the ban would affect her ability to work during a long flight to greensboro n c for a conference in april “this is a   flight” she said “i think as an academic or any business traveler the function of a work flight is to be able to work on it especially if you’re going to a conference ” osama sharshar a prominent egyptian lawmaker and journalist who frequently travels to the united states was critical of the changes and suggested president trump issued the order simply to “please the   extremists in america ” “it will terribly affect me as a journalist a lawmaker and a regular egyptian” he said “i work on planes all the time and the flight to the states is very long ” the homeland security department’s new ban appeared to take officials from some of the affected countries by surprise ahmet arslan turkey’s transport maritime and communication minister said the ban would be harmful to the united states’ airline industry  —   and to turkey’s “our problem is not how the practice would take place” mr arslan said “the issue is it can decrease the comfort of the passengers and reduce the numbers of passengers we are emphasizing that this is not in the benefit of passengers and we think that they should step back from this or ease it ” counterterrorism experts seemed equally divided over the need for the device ban michael chertoff the former homeland security secretary said the new policy made sense given the threats to aircraft from explosive devices and concerns about screening at the targeted airports “the challenge is to balance security without making it impossible to fly” mr chertoff said but erroll southers director of the homegrown violent extremism studies program at the university of southern california said the new guidance would do little to enhance security “this does little to minimize the threat of a   i e d ” he said referring to improvised explosive devices hidden in checked baggage american intelligence officials did not cite threats against domestic airports but one said the transportation security administration has been on heightened alert at several airports it was not clear if that alert was related to the new restrictions on electronic devices the restrictions follow other recent changes the t s a has made in aviation security two weeks ago the agency adopted enhanced   searches for passengers at united states airports a response to what it said were weaknesses in airport screening measures under the new rules passengers will no longer be allowed to choose what type of searches they undergo in security lines',\n",

       " 'exclusive — audio emerges of when paul ryan abandoned donald trump ‘i am not going to defend donald trump—not now not in the future’ on a    private october conference call with house republican members house speaker paul ryan told his members in the u s house of representatives he was abandoning   presidential nominee donald trump forever and would never defend him ever again in the oct   call from right after the access hollywood tape of trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election ryan does not specify that he will never defend trump on just the access hollywood tape —  he says clearly he is done with trump altogether  “i am not going to defend donald trump —  not now not in the future” ryan says in the audio obtained by breitbart news and published here for the first time ever now ryan —  still the speaker —  has pushed now president donald trump to believe his healthcare legislation the american health care act would repeal and replace obamacare when it does not repeal obamacare ryan has also according to trump ally sen rand paul   misled president trump into believing that ryan’s bill can pass congress paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the u s senate since a number of gop senators have come out against it and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the house this is the first major initiative that trump has worked on with ryan —  and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether speaker ryan the gop’s failed  vice presidential nominee who barely supported trump at all in  really understands how trump won and how to win in general the october conference call apparently was intended only for house republican members it’s unclear which or how many house republicans took part in the call whether the participants knew it was being recorded who made the recording or whether a recording exists of the entire call the remarks on the portion provided to breitbart news certainly sound like they were coming from speaker ryan who seemed to be abandoning his party’s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election he says not only will he not defend the access hollywood comments but he will not campaign with trump at all between this call on oct   and the general election for the presidency on nov  —  and that ryan would not defend trump on anything generally ryan followed through on his promise to not campaign with trump abandoning the now president in the final crucial weeks leading up to the   general election but trump won anyway in a landslide in the electoral college crushing democrat hillary rodham clinton this audio file means that trump won all  of his electoral votes on his own without ryan including the  he won in ryan’s home state of wisconsin as soon as trump won without ryan’s help ryan aligned himself with then   trump and now president trump —  acting like he never abandoned him on the campaign trail and never disinvited the president from a rally in his district ryan’s comments on this oct  call came after a female voice —  it’s unclear if the woman was a house member or not —  opened up the call he called trump’s access hollywood comments indefensible and said they do not fit with the republican party’s “principles and values ” ryan also told house members on the call that he would not be campaigning with trump and that each member should make their own decision with regards to trump over the next several weeks at that point abandon the gop nominee for president like ryan was doing or stand with him a number of members joined ryan in abandoning trump both of those two sections of the call have been previously reported in media although those media reports lacked audio of ryan to back them up but the more important line is the line where ryan says —  without specifying this was about the access hollywood leak —  that he will never defend donald trump again “his comments are not anywhere in keeping with our party’s principles and values” ryan said “there are basically two things that i want to make really clear as for myself as your speaker i am not going to defend donald trump —  not now not in the future as you probably heard i disinvited him from my first congressional district gop event this weekend —  a thing i do every year and i’m not going to be campaigning with him over the next  days ” “look you guys know i have real concerns with our nominee” ryan continued “i hope you appreciate that i’m doing what i think is best for you the members not what’s best for me so i want to do what’s best for our members and i think this is the right thing to do i’m going to focus my time on campaigning for house republicans i talked to a bunch of you over the last  hours and here is basically my takeaway to everyone on this call this is going to be a turbulent month many of you on this call are facing tough reelections some of you are not but with respect to donald trump i would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do personally you need to decide what’s best for you and you all know what’s best for you where you are ” later in the audio ryan does clarify that the “last thing” he wanted to do was help clinton ascend to the presidency “but the last thing i want to do is to help hillary clinton get the presidency and get congress” ryan said “look she’s a failed progressive she’s running an abysmal campaign i mean it’s just —  it’s amazing how easily she could be beaten she will take this country in the wrong direction and the last thing we need is four more years of obama policies or two years of a clinton presidency with a democrat congress could you imagine what that would look like so the last thing we want to be doing is giving hillary clinton a blank check in congress ” “that’s why i’m going to spend the rest of this month fighting for congress fighting for our majorities” ryan continued “i’m going to spend the next  days working hard with all of our members to get   because we need a check on hillary clinton if donald trump and mike pence don’t win the presidency greg walden will get more into what that looks like and what polling looks like but i want to basically close with this his comments are indefensible they’re not in keeping with our principles so i’m not going to try to defend him i’m going to focus on congress i’m going to focus on upholding our values we have a great great policy agenda —  a better way —  that we need to take to voters and show what our party actually stands for and what it’s stood for for generations ” listen to audio of paul ryan’s oct   conference call with house gop in response to this audio surfacing ryan spokesman brendan buck told breitbart news “the world is well aware of this history ” “and obviously a lot has happened since then as everyone knows” buck added in a   email in a third   email buck clarified about the comments from ryan that “of course they were” specifically about the access hollywood tapes “this was in response to that but as everyone knows they came together toward the end of the campaign and the speaker vocally supported him and even campaigned with pence” buck said but ryan never campaigned with trump it’s worth noting that the person ryan leaned on for political advice in abandoning trump during this conference call was now house energy and commerce committee chairman rep greg walden   walden at the time was chairman of the national republican congressional committee nrcc this audio file obtained by breitbart news does not include walden’s comments so it’s unclear exactly what he said but walden is now one of ryan’s top lieutenants in the house of representatives leading the promotion of this healthcare legislation —  and one of the two committee chairmen who kept his committee in session overnight to speed up the   of the legislation last week ryan’s decision to abandon trump on the campaign trail has become a focal point in healthcare negotiations while meeting with conservative leaders last week at the white house this exact topic came up —  as tea party patriots’ jenny beth martin and trump shared an exchange that was particularly awkward for white house chief of staff and ryan ally reince priebus “inside the oval office last week there was a telling exchange between conservative activist jenny beth martin and the president” jonathan swan of axios reported on sunday night adding during trump’s wednesday meeting with conservative leaders over the healthcare plan tea party patriots leader martin subtly reminded trump that her   stood by him ‘through thick and thin’ during the campaign unlike a certain politician from wisconsin according to two sources in the room martin didn’t mention paul ryan’s name but everyone knew who she was talking about she reminded trump that in october  —   when the crude ‘access hollywood’ tape leaked and ryan disinvited trump from a wisconsin event  —   tea party patriots citizens fund volunteers were working the phones on trump’s behalf trump smiled and glanced over at his chief of staff reince priebus trump said that yes he had been disinvited and he thanked martin for standing by him ryan has been unwilling to negotiate on the specifics of his bill which has earned multiple negative monikers like “obamacare  ” “obamacare lite” “ryancare” and “ ” from detractors but president trump and his true allies despite what ryan’s allies inside the white house say publicly have been much more willing to negotiate according to house and senate conservatives who have had direct conversations with the president “we have gotten a signal from the white house that the bill might be completely pulled and a more transparent and inclusive process could start as early as next week” one senior republican senate aide told breitbart news on friday “house leadership misled the white house on how popular this bill would be with conservatives ” “that would be excellent news and the best way to ensure we actually deliver on what we told the voters we would do” another senior congressional aide told breitbart news when asked about the possibility ryan’s bill might be pulled altogether and a new renegotiated bill introduced afterwards “the bill as is cannot pass and there is a growing chorus of republican members in both houses growing impatient with the current unwillingness to make any changes to the current house bill ” “they’ll start to fold soon if the conservative groups hold firm” one senior house gop aide in an office whose member is against the bill will not vote for it in its current form or without significant changes under any circumstances and is not in the house freedom caucus told breitbart news house gop leadership offices —  particularly ryan’s and house majority leader kevin mccarthy’s team —  have not responded to requests for comment on the possibility the bill may be pulled altogether but white house press secretary sean spicer who is working internally as hard as he can to help ryan on this front regardless of the impact on trump along with a handful of other white house aides who came from the republican national committee and are not trump loyalists told breitbart news that the idea the bill may be pulled is “false ” but in conversations breitbart news has had with no fewer than  other white house aides including many on the press team it is clear that the president and the senior trump administration team are not happy with this bill’s lack of conservative support the president and his team were assured by ryan that conservatives would in fact be on board with it in the beginning something that has turned out to not be accurate interestingly much more so than ryan and his house gop leadership team the white house is much more open to significant negotiation on the details in a healthcare bill —  including the structure vehicle timeline and more several senior white house aides confirmed to breitbart news that while the administration is publicly touting the bill as the party line the president is much more willing to wheel and deal on this front than ryan loyalists on his team would have anyone believe “the president gave ryan a chance” one source close to the president said “if he doesn’t get his act together soon the president will have no choice but to step in and fix this on his own he’s the best negotiator on the planet and if this were his bill not ryan’s it would not be this much of a mess ” in fact the president himself on monday said he is working on negotiating on this healthcare bill “we’re negotiating with everybody” trump said “it’s a big fat beautiful negotiation and hopefully we’ll come up with something that’s going to be really terrific ” what’s more the bill has virtually zero chance of ever passing the senate should it get there sens paul mike lee   tom cotton   lindsey graham   james lankford   dean heller   susan collins   ted cruz   and ben sasse   —  among other gop senators —  have all raised concerns about it paul lee and cotton have been particularly vocal while graham has raised concerns with the process cotton particularly warned his old house colleagues to not vote for ryan’s bill “the bill probably can be fixed but it’s going to take a lot of carpentry on that framework” cotton said adding the key warning “do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that cannot pass the senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote” “i’m not going to give into demands by members of congress or the senate if i don’t believe it’s in the interest of the american people and just walk away from the frigging table” graham said last week according to politico sasse meanwhile has privately raised concerns about the process and viability of the bill according to a senate gop aide while a source close to sasse has confirmed to breitbart news he raised those concerns politico has reported on heller’s serious concerns with ryan’s bill and collins said she agrees with paul —  for different reasons —  that the bill is dead on arrival in the senate lankford in a monday morning radio interview confirmed he also has serious concerns with the house bill and that he is introducing his own obamacare replacement legislation in the senate on tuesday cruz’s office confirmed to breitbart news he has had several meetings with white house officials house members and senate leadership officials making the case for an improved house bill cruz has also argued that republicans can get around the senate’s parliamentarian on budget reconciliation because he says the vice president —  mike pence —  “has the statutory and constitutional authority as does the senate majority to rule to the contrary” of what the parliamentarian says given the fact there are only  republicans in the u s senate only three republicans are needed to stop a piece of legislation that has no support from any democrats this bill is expected to get no support from democrats so the nine republicans that breitbart news can confirm have serious issues with the house bill —  while not all necessarily  percent against it —  are more than enough to stop this bill dead in its tracks if it ever reaches them that brings up the next question which is whether ryan’s legislation has enough support to pass the u s house of representatives at this time since the house freedom caucus is united against it —  more than  members comprise the house freedom caucus —  it appears the answer is no ryan can only afford to lose around  republican votes depending on absences and vacancies since he is aiming to pass the bill with zero support from any democrats and while ryan is attempting to browbeat  or so of the house freedom caucus members into submission on this legislation using his affiliated outside groups to run ads against them in their districts —  while not spending anything on targeting democrats —  house gop sources in   caucus offices tell breitbart news that there are as many as perhaps  house republicans against this bill at this time and that number is not getting any smaller as time goes by so if ryan is able to muscle it through the house in the next few weeks —  sources close to the process expect a battle to come on the rule vote which may happen next week or the week after —  it will be on life support headed to a senate that does not support it since conservatives are not warming up to it by any stretch now on top of all of this this new audio file raises questions as to how loyal ryan is to trump politically —  and is asking the new president to use precious political capital to push through legislation that seems arithmetically destined for congressional failure that could doom or at least dampen other key elements of the trump agenda like tax reform immigration reform national security efforts budgetary reforms building up of the u s military trade renegotiation and more as such as breitbart news has previously reported there are now rumblings among house republicans that they may want a replacement not just of obamacare but a replacement of paul ryan as speaker a new speaker some argue would make life much easier for president trump as he moves forward with his agenda so the argument goes as some house gop members have told breitbart news is that if healthcare is this rocky then tax reform immigration trade policy and other key trump agenda items will be worse',\n",

wholly reassure allies worried about the new president’s stance on russia and the european union in pence’s first major foreign policy address for the trump administration he told european leaders that he spoke for trump when he promised “unwavering” commitment to the nato alliance  “today on behalf of president trump i bring you this assurance the united states of america strongly supports nato and will be unwavering in our commitment to this transatlantic alliance” pence told the munich security conference offering “greetings” from the president but he also repeated us calls for more defense spending in return “as you keep faith with us under president trump we will always keep faith with you” while poland’s defense minister praised pence many others including france’s foreign minister and us lawmakers in munich remained skeptical that he had convinced his allies that trump would stand by europe   trump’s contradictory remarks on the value of the north atlantic treaty organisation scepticism over the  deal to curb iran’s nuclear ambitions and an apparent disregard for the future of the european union have left europe fearful for the sevendecadeold us guardianship of the west after pence spoke former nato deputy secretary general alexander vershbow who is american summed up the mood telling reuters “many in this hall are still asking if this is the real policy” pence whose meeting with german chancellor angela merkel was described by german aides as “very friendly” also marked out a divide on iran which the european union sees as a business opportunity following the nuclear deal  pence called tehran “the leading state sponsor of terrorism” language never used by european officials pence’s strident vow to consign islamist militants “to the ashheap of history” also raised eyebrows european officials said us homeland security secretary john kelly defended trump’s directive suspending travel to the united states by citizens of seven mostly muslim countries since blocked by us judges which was condemned by eu governments kelly said he would produce a “tighter more streamlined version” soon saying “we need to find ways to vet in a more reliable way to satisfy us that people coming to the united states are coming for the right reasons”  french foreign minister jeanmarc ayrault expressed  disappointment that pence’s speech did not mention the european union although the vice president will take his message to eu headquarters in brussels on monday “i hope that we will have a clear response in brussels  because donald trump has said he was overjoyed by the brexit and that there would be others” ayrault said referring to britain’s decision to leave the european union us senator chris murphy a member of the opposition democrats said he welcomed pence’s address but saw two rival governments emerging from the trump administration  pence trump’s defense secretary jim mattis and his foreign minister rex tillerson all delivered messages of reassurance on their debut trip to europe but events in washington including a news conference in which trump branded accredited white house reporters “dishonest people” sowed more confusion “i like a lot of what i heard from vice president pence” murphy told reuters “it’s just hard to square that speech with everything donald trump is doing and saying” citing an assault on the free press the resignation of trump’s security adviser michael flynn over his contacts with russia on the eve of the us charm offensive in europe also tarnished the message pence mattis and tillerson were seeking to send officials told reuters us republican senator john mccain a trump critic told the conference on friday that the new president’s team was “in disarray” the united states is europe’s biggest trading partner the biggest foreign investor in the continent and the european union’s partner in almost all foreign policy as well as the main promoter of european unity for more than  years pence citing a trip to cold warera west berlin in his youth said trump would uphold the postworld war two order “this is president trump’s promise we will stand with europe today and every day because we are bound together by the same noble ideals – freedom democracy justice and the rule of law” pence said pence received little applause beyond the warm reception he got when he declared his support for nato his warning that the “time has come to do more” on military spending was met with an awkward silence  the united states provides around  percent of the nato alliance’s funds european

ukraine nine years ago met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago it is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in kyiv instead of the usa\\n kyiv is a beautiful and lively city beautiful architecture – andreevska church\\nkyiv is a worthy capital city it has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments there are many many targets for a tourist camera the walled city was built to be defensible situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the dnieper river close to where the desno river joins from the east  miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia\\nthe sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isn’t frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of one’s choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters\\nthe soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride\\nyoung people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafés and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city\\nkyiv is home to ukraine’s most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit — an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states\\n ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course\\nkyiv is a very inexpensive place to live… very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in

under  that is just the start\\nfor those of us who live here ¢ metro rides—buses and trams are even less—make life cheap and convenient try the grocery store—¢ a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states  a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians’ utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars\\nmedical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it… and it

important jobs to bother being neighborly\\nthe fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc\\npeople always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian\\nlastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you can’t blame it on the drivers\\n young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting\\nstudents and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called square—delightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one

fought back in  they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the world’s attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because

       " 'tesla reports another fraudulent quarter financial markets  market manipulation  us economy accounting fraud  elon musk  tesla  tsla admin \\ntesla created massive confusion in the financial reporting and analyst community by allegedly coming clean and report actual gaap quarterly financial results for its rd quarter but of course just like the entire us banana republic the use of extreme obfuscation deceit propaganda and lies once again is the norm with tesla’s quarterly report \\ntsla’s use of revenue recognition deferred revenue and operating leases and its definition of “free cash flow” are enough to create a dedicated forensic accounting case study at the university of chicago graduate school of business where i did indeed nearly ace a forensic accounting course \\ni don’t have enough time to lay out all of specifics and i’m not getting paid to write this blog post – but suffice it to say that several items in tesla’s financials this quarter serve as big red flag warning flares of course the market probably won’t care as it seems that the market cap of a company’s stock is directly proportional to the grandiosity of the company’s accounting abuse and fraud and there’s no one in dc to enforce the laws already in place that are designed to prevent this fraud because the guys running these companies make substantial contributions to the establishment politicians – just ask jeff bezos and hillary clinton \\nbut i’ll point out some of the glaring problems in tsla’s “gaap” accounting based on cursory sleuthing \\nfirst and foremost in his description of the results for the quarter musk stated that “residual lease risk” exposure was  of deliveries down from  in q but this is a highly deceptive metric in fact  deferred revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter soared to  from  in q deferred revenue is the amount of revenue that is subject to “residual risk” from leasing financing this number is found on the liability side of the balance sheet the deferred revenue liability account went from  million in q to  billion in q this is a huge jump in amount of riskinfused leasebased financing used to generate sales \\nin and of itself using deferred revenue accounting to this degree is highly subjective and susceptible to fraudulent risk assumptions but the fact that musk tries to mask the truth by using a bogus metric to make it seem like tsla’s exposure to the residual risk embedded in the profoundly questionable leases used to generate revenues and unit sales is a loud signal that there’s fraud embedded in tsla’s “gaap” financials \\nwhen you look at what is being reported as “gaap operating income” consider that a huge proportion of that income is subject to the risk of coming back at the company in form of “onetime” gaap charges which result from having to reverse out a large portion of the “gaap” revenues when the value attached to the cars that will likely come flying back at tsla when the leases expire is substantially lower than the amount guaranteed by tsla this “gaap” presentation makes a farce of bona fide accounting standards \\nanother huge red flag is the huge jump in accounts payable in june accounts payable were  of revenues but by september accounts payable were more than  of revenues the only reason tsla would stretch out its payables like this is if it needed the cash not paying bills for a company like tsla is a source of free financing but this is an extreme slowdown in bill payments there’s no way to know for sure what’s going on but something is wrong \\na third huge red flag is the way in which musk throws around the term “free cash flow” his definition is just as fraudulent as amazoncon’s definition at this point in time because tsla has only released an k which does not contain an gaap statement of cash flows there’s no way to know the amount of free or negative free cash flow attributable to tsla’s operations that is “free cash flow” in the context of the deceitful manner in which tsla’s financials are presented \\nhaving said that musk states in the k that tsla generated “positive free cash flow” no elon you did not buried in the k is a section titled “selected cash flow information” he lays out his definition of “free cash flow” showing  million defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less capex the gaap definition of free cash flow however also includes debt repayment and other sundry items that drain cash we won’t know the full extent of these items until the q is released \\nhowever tsla reported that it payed down  million on its borrowing facilities using gaap free cash flow this takes elon free cash flow negative furthermore if tsla had maintained accounts payable at  of revenues this would have sucked another  million of cash from tsla’s operations leaving the company with a free cash flow deficit of  million \\nthere’s a lot more going on with tsla’s operations that is deceitful if not outright fraudulent this is just the “low hanging fruit” at some point the capital markets will stop funding this fraud and that’s when the fun begins of course by that time insiders will have sucked ’s of millions of wealth out this company that will never be retrievable in just the last  months insiders have unloaded  million shares or roughly  million worth of stock oh wait there was one open market purchase of stock by an insider of a whopping  shares \\nit’s my view the idiotic shareholders who give money to tsla deserve what they’ll get eventually but then again many of them are sheeple who have placed trust in financial fiduciaries like pension managers and investment advisors to invest their savings share this',\n",

       " 'yale will drop john calhoun’s name from building  the new york times after a swelling tide of protests the president of yale announced on saturday that the university would change the name of a residential college commemorating john c calhoun the   white supremacist statesman from south carolina the college will be renamed for grace murray hopper a trailblazing computer scientist and navy rear admiral who received a master’s degree and a doctorate from yale the decision was a stark reversal of the university’s decision last spring to maintain the name despite broad opposition though the president peter salovey said that he was still “concerned about erasing history” he said that “these are exceptional circumstances ” “i made this decision because i think it is the right thing to do on principle” mr salovey said on a conference call with reporters “john c calhoun’s principles his legacy as an ardent supporter of slavery as a positive good are at odds with this university ” mr salovey and the other members of the yale corporation the university’s governing body made their decision after an advisory committee unanimously recommended the renaming the school is still determining when exactly the change will be carried out but mr salovey said it would be by fall at the latest students reacted with joy to a change many said was long overdue “there’s a huge sense of relief and celebration” said rianna    a senior from ann arbor mich who was involved in the protests “students of color have been fighting for this change for decades and it’s hard to believe this day is finally here ” online some students found inspiration in a quotation from ms hopper who died in  “humans are allergic to change” she once said “they love to say ‘we’ve always done it this way’ i try to fight that ” calhoun the nation’s seventh vice president attended yale and was its valedictorian the name of the college incited controversy almost as soon as it opened in  many black students staged demonstrations and referred to the college which was decorated with depictions of slaves carrying bales of cotton as the “calhoun plantation ” opposition may have peaked in  after the massacre of nine worshipers at a black church in charleston the killings by an avowed white supremacist prompted protests that led to the removal of the confederate battle flag outside the south carolina statehouse and elsewhere yale was seized that fall by a series of demonstrations from students faculty and alumni who objected to the calhoun name as well as to what they saw as a larger climate of racial inequality on campus many universities domestic and abroad have faced similar pressure in recent years to eradicate names and symbols of racism and colonialism on campus that resistance notwithstanding mr salovey announced last april that yale would preserve the calhoun name at the same time he revealed that the university’s two new residential colleges would be named for benjamin franklin and anna pauline murray the honoring of ms murray a legal scholar and civil rights activist who graduated from yale law school in  was widely hailed as the first such distinction bestowed on either a woman or an   but the selection of franklin who was once a slaveholder himself was derided by many students particularly after it became clear that he was chosen in deference to a suggestion by charles b johnson a businessman who donated  million for the new buildings  —   the largest gift in the school’s history addressing a related concern the school also decided then that the leaders of the residential colleges would no longer use the title “master” and would instead be called “heads of college” a recognition of the discomfort many students felt toward the previous honorific’s evocation of slavery the calhoun and franklin decisions reignited protests from student activists who held a “renaming ceremony” in front of the college in which they called it “the college formerly known as calhoun ” at a town   meeting soon after students showered mr salovey with fake  million bills a protest against what they saw as the university prioritizing its financial interests over their concerns the dissent did not come only from students over the summer a black dishwasher in calhoun smashed a stained glass windowpane that depicted slaves working on a plantation because he said he found the image degrading and on friday four demonstrators protesting the calhoun name were arrested for blocking the street still despite their delight about the renaming many students hope that the university will continue to move beyond symbolism to address more pressing issues of racial inequality on campus like the dearth of black faculty members during the fall  protests the university announced that it was committing  million to a   initiative to confront the fact that less than  percent of its arts and sciences faculty is black but since that time several prominent black professors have left the university about  percent of yale’s roughly   undergraduates identify themselves as black or   “this is definitely a victory but we’re not done fighting” ms   said “it’s our job to keep pushing yale in the right direction ”',\n",

also called for mugabe s wife grace whose ambitions to succeed her husband triggered the unfolding political crisis to resign from the party  mugabe appeared in public on friday for the first time since the army took charge as the ruling party made plans to force him to step down after almost four decades in power the president who is  opened a graduation ceremony at zimbabwe open university in harare he wore blue and yellow academic robes and a mortar board hat and appeared to fall asleep in his chair as his eyes closed and his head lolled mugabe led the country s liberation struggle and has dominated its politics since independence in  a senior member of the zanupf ruling party said it wanted him gone  if he becomes stubborn we will arrange for him to be fired on sunday  the source said  when that is done it s impeachment on tuesday  the herald reported that zanupf would convene a special central committee meeting on sunday to  realign the revolutionary party with current political developments  the military which seized power on wednesday has so far treated mugabe carefully it said in a statement on national television it was  engaging  with mugabe referred to him as commander in chief and said it would announce an outcome as soon as possible zanupf has also called for a mass meeting in the capital on saturday to show its support for the war veterans group in their bid to remove mugabe the veterans mugabe s former comrades from the liberation war who enjoyed a privileged position under his rule for decades had chafed in recent years as his wife grace positioned herself to succeed him they finally turned on him decisively after he sacked vice president emmerson mnangagwa last week the herald newspaper on friday said that zanupf wanted mnangagwa reinstated as vice president because he was dismissed  without endorsement of the central committee  many zimbabweans suspect the military s plan is to hand power to mnangagwa a longserving mugabe confidant and liberation war veteran nicknamed  the crocodile  if so the generals may be waiting until mnangagwa can be reinstated as vice president before arranging for mugabe to resign mugabe is revered as an elder statesman and independence leader but he is also viewed by many in africa as a president who crippled his country by remaining in power too long he calls himself the grand old man of african politics zimbabwe s official newspaper the herald ran photographs late on thursday showing mugabe grinning and shaking hands with military chief general constantino chiwenga who led the army takeover the images stunned zimbabweans who said it meant mugabe was managing to hold out against chiwenga s coup some political sources said he was trying to delay his departure until elections scheduled for next year the zanupf source said he would not be able to stay that long anxious to avoid a protracted stalemate party leaders were drawing up plans to dismiss mugabe at the weekend if he refused to quit the source said  there is no going back  the source told reuters  it s like a match delayed by heavy rain with the home side leading  in the th minute  the army is camped on his doorstep grace mugabe is under house arrest and her key political allies are in military custody the police once a bastion of support for mugabe have showed no signs of resistance to the army furthermore he has little popular backing in the capital a stronghold of support for opposition parties that have tapped into the anger and frustration at his handling of the economy which collapsed after the seizure of whiteowned farms in  after stabilising briefly when mugabe was forced to work with the opposition in a  unity government the economy has collapsed again unemployment is now running at nearly  percent and chronic shortages of hard currency have triggered hyperinflation with the prices of imports rising as much as  percent a month mugabe has won a series of elections but his critics in africa and the west say his handling of the economy has been disastrous and he has used violence to maintain power botswana s president ian khama told him to resign  i don t think anyone should be president for that amount of time we are presidents we are not monarchs it s just common sense  khama said still african states are keen that whatever outcome is achieved in zimbabwe it happens within the framework of the constitution which may give mugabe some leverage over the terms of his departure  we note with great concern the unfolding political development in zimbabwe and we hope that they will not lead to unconstitutional change of government  south african president jacob zuma said at a southern african development community meeting in botswana s capital gaborone

       " 'fbi interviews hillary clinton over private email server  the new york times the f b i interviewed hillary clinton on saturday morning for its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state a controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign and provided fodder for her political rivals the voluntary interview which took place over three and a half hours at the f b i headquarters in washington largely focused on the justice department’s central question did the actions of mrs clinton or her staff rise to the level of criminal mishandling of classified information it could take weeks or longer to reach a decision but news that mrs clinton the democratic party’s presumptive nominee had been questioned in the j edgar hoover building three weeks before her party’s convention quickly reverberated the republican national committee called the step “unprecedented” while mrs clinton’s expected opponent in the race for the white house donald j trump wasted little time before weighing in “it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton” mr trump wrote on twitter on saturday “what she did was wrong” the interview had been weeks in the making as law enforcement officials and mrs clinton’s team coordinated schedules democrats also hoped that holding the interview on a holiday weekend might ease the anticipated storm in a telephone interview with chuck todd on msnbc after her meeting mrs clinton said “i’ve been eager to do it and i was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion ” accompanying mrs clinton into the meeting were her lawyer david e kendall cheryl d mills and heather samuelson longtime aides who are also lawyers and two lawyers from mr kendall’s firm williams  connolly katherine turner and amy saharia eight officials from the f b i and the department of justice conducted the interview according to a person who was familiar with the substance of the session but declined to be named because the meeting was private this person characterized the meeting as “civil” and “businesslike ” neither the campaign nor the f b i would elaborate although the interview on saturday was an important step toward closure on the email issue technical analysis of the material remains to be done and could stretch on for an indeterminate period the f b i regularly interviews key figures before concluding an investigation and such meetings are not an indication that it thinks the person broke the law while defense lawyers often advise clients against such interviews mrs clinton’s campaign has been eager for her to cooperate lest she give her opponents additional ammunition on saturday in a statement after the meeting the republican national committee said that mrs clinton “has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the f b i as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct ” mrs clinton has struggled to get beyond the issue which came to light last year during a   congressional investigation into the aftermath of the sept   terrorist attack in benghazi libya more than   emails have since been made public after spending much of last summer arguing she did not need to apologize for keeping a private server in her home in chappaqua n y because the practice was allowed mrs clinton now frequently apologizes for the practice saying it had been a mistake the campaign has prioritized assisting the f b i but it declined to cooperate with a state department inspector general’s audit of mrs clinton’s email practices those findings delivered to members of congress in may undermined some of mrs clinton’s initial statements defending her use of the server the report said there was “no evidence” that she had requested or received approval for the server despite having “an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business ” federal law deems it a crime to “knowingly” mishandle classified information outside secure government channels or to permit the practice through “gross negligence ” none of the emails on mrs clinton’s private server were marked classified at the time they were sent or received but the central intelligence agency later determined that some contained material that would be considered “top secret ” asked saturday on msnbc if she had broken the law mrs clinton repeated her defense “i never received nor sent any material that was marked classified ” there has been no indication that sensitive information was compromised by mrs clinton’s use of a private server but it has fed a perception that she was trying to hide information chipping away at data gauging her trustworthiness a quinnipiac university poll released on wednesday found that voters deemed mr trump more honest and trustworthy than mrs clinton  percent to  percent “i have said that i’m going to continue to put forth my record what i have stood for do everything i can to earn the trust of the voters of our country” she told msnbc when asked about being seen as less trustworthy than mr trump “i know that’s something that i’m going to keep working on and i think that’s you know a clear priority for me ” mrs clinton had no public events scheduled on saturday but after her f b i interview she and her husband former president bill clinton went to new york and saw the broadway show “hamilton ” mrs clinton’s meeting with the f b i came amid controversy over a brief unplanned meeting between mr clinton and attorney general loretta e lynch while both were at the phoenix airport at the same time last week to avoid any appearance of political meddling ms lynch said on friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the f b i director on whether to bring charges in the matter she said she had made that decision several months ago before the criticism surrounding her meeting with mr clinton she described the meeting with mr clinton as a casual conversation that did not touch on the investigation but it added to clinton campaign staff members’ headaches over the email inquiry which they had hoped to put behind them before the democratic convention this month

quarter chocolate milk for athletes suffering from concussions you might have wondered if it was an april fools jokeaccording to those press releases university researchers discovered that chocolate milk  helps improve the cognitive and motor functions of high school football players even after suffering concussions not just any chocolate milk will do though the university s press releases claimed that a specific brand fifth quarters stands head and shoulders above other brands of chocolate milk when it comes to boosting the brain power of athletes and concussion sufferersa press release posted in july of last year read more like a latenight infomercial hosted by dr oz  rather than a university press releasetitled  super natural cows make the best sports recovery drinks  it touted not just best the benefits of fifth quarters chocolate milk but the benefits of capitalism too proclaimingthe magic formula for the ultimate sports recovery drink starts with cows runs through the university of maryland and ends with capitalismaccording to the press release which has since been removed from the university s website but is still accessible through google cacherichard doak and kurt williams stood behind a fence at a high school football game in the mountains of western maryland and wondered why kids were getting injured more often if it wasn t their training they thought then it had to be their nutritionnext they did what any good parents would do they conducted research created a solution and started a company so athletes everywhere could benefit from their discoveryif you think this sounds more like a cheesy advertisement than a summary of academic research you wouldn t be aloneit gets worseaccording to the press release doak and williams were surprised by what they discovered the freshest milk legally possible from the best cows provided more of what athletes  bodies need than any artificial commercial drink protein  grams as much as most whey drinks along with a special kind of protein that remains available for hours after drinking it electrolytes far more than products on the shelf and calcium and vitamin d for strong bones they added natural cane sugar and cocoa to make it tasty for kids and to restore glycogen to musclesbut of course they needed proof of thisthat s why they gave the university of maryland  to conduct  research  through umd s industrial partnership s programto understand what that program is and what it means to the future of independent and ethical research look no further than the school s own description of it which cites  academicindustrial publicprivate partnerships in other words this is a program that conducts privatelyfunded research on behalf of businesses and corporationsin this case the ethical problems were entirely obviouswithout releasing any details on the study the press release proclaimed thatjae kun shim a professor of kinesiology in the school of public health conducted a yearlong study to test how well fifth quarter fresh aides the postexercise recovery of muscular endurance compared to other popular sports drinks it outperformed competing products by  percent it included the following remarks from professor shim i knew they had a highquality milk with less damaged protein than whey protein drinks and more electrolytes but i didn t expect it would make much difference for strength endurance recovery there are many studies out there that show the cardiovascular recovery benefits from milkbased products but this data is unique because we are showing that the muscular endurance recovery from this chocolate milk is significant our data suggests that athletes may be ready faster and better for the next game or practice if they drink fifth quarter fresh chocolate milk and that s not all folk according to industry spokespersons who had a heavy hand in both the research and the press releaseone secret to making higher quality milk doak and williams discovered is in the cows jerseys and guernseys whose milk innately has higher amounts of protein electrolytes calcium and carbohydrates than the milk we typically buy in stores store milk is produced primarily by holsteins which comprise  percent of the herds in the us simply because they produce more milk per cowit went on to claim jerseys naturally produce the highest quality milk for human consumption  said erick metzger general manager of national alljersey inc an industry group  compared to average milk a glass of jersey milk has greater nutritional value nutrientdense jersey milk tastes better because there are more nonfat solids protein and calcium in jersey milk when compared with other breeds the university was forced to retract the study refunding the  it received from fifth quarters and other milk producers to conduct what professor shim described as a  research projecton friday the university announced the results of the school s internal investigation into the projectas cbs news reports here the university s investigation found a concerning lack of understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research at all levels of the process you don t saythe university of maryland s  chocolatemilkcuresconcussions  research is likely to go down in history as some of the worst corporatefunded pseudoscience of our timethe lack of ethics applied by researchers in this specific study are glaringly apparent even to the most casual observerthe real concern is that this type of corporatefunded research is taking place more and more often in the united states fossil fuel companies pay big money to any  researcher  willing to deny climate change or demonstrate how safe fracking isthe pharmaceutical industry funds the research that determines whether or not the products it markets to consumers are safe while biotech corporations fund research into the safety of gmo the list of industries buying science goes on and onwhile we often hear

friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies a crucial step as he prepares to accept the party’s nomination next week some conservatives who had fought against trump’s ascendancy in the republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked pence a wellknown social and evangelical conservative the club for growth a conservative economic group had sharply criticized trump’s support for protectionist trade policies on friday the group noted that as a member of the house of representatives pence had been a strong voice for “free markets and economic liberty” at a time when the republican leadership had been weak on these issues “today’s news gives a similar hope that mike pence will be  effective in pulling the republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government” the group said other conservatives were also heartened by trump’s vp pick which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of new york on saturday “pence is a principled conservative man of faith and talented messenger for republican ideas” said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell “his addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a republican in the white house and deny a third term for president obama’s liberal agenda” trump  chose pence  over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich  and new jersey governor chris christie  pence is viewed as a safe choice for trump the indiana governor’s lowkey demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer and he could take the fight to the democrats in the months leading up to the nov  election without upstaging trump he and trump will have to smooth over some policy differences pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states two policies that are central to trump’s campaign message in his first public remarks after trump announced his running mate pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on muslims entering the country after he called it  “offensive and unconstitutional” in a tweet last december “i am very supportive of donald trump’s call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the united states” pence told conservative fox news commentator sean hannity “we have no higher priority than the safety and security of the american people” pence said adding that he suspended a syrian refugee program in indiana after a shooting rampage last year in san bernardino california  pence also said he “absolutely” backed trump’s promise to build a wall between the united states and mexico to stem illegal immigration and make mexico pay for it trump said pence had done a great job in indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job “there’s nobody that agrees with me fully on everything” pence’s selection was slammed by democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign “by picking mike pence as his running mate donald trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families” said clinton campaign chairman john podesta trump had faced a midday friday deadline to announce pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for reelection trump had postponed his announcement which had been planned for friday out of respect for the victims in nice france an attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating bastille day killing at least  people and injuring scores more in what president francois hollande called a terrorist

       " 'scott pruitt faces anger from right over epa finding he won’t fight  the new york times washington  —   when president trump chose the oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt to lead the environmental protection agency his mission was clear carry out mr trump’s campaign vows to radically reduce the size and scope of the agency and take apart president barack obama’s ambitious climate change policies in his first weeks on the job mr pruitt drew glowing praise from foes of mr obama’s agenda against global warming as he moved to roll back its centerpiece known as the clean power plan and expressed agreement with those who said the e p a should be eliminated his actions and statements have galvanized protests from environmentalists and others on the left but now a growing chorus of critics on the other end of the political spectrum say mr pruitt has not gone far enough in particular they are angry that he has refused to challenge a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding which provides the legal basis for mr obama’s clean power plan and other global warming policies these critics say that mr pruitt is hacking only at the branches of current climate policy they want him to pull it out by the roots “the endangerment finding must be redone or all of this is for naught” said steven j milloy who runs a website junkscience com aimed at debunking the established science of   climate change and who worked on the trump administration’s e p a transition team “if you get rid of the endangerment finding the rest of the climate regulations just sweep themselves away but if they don’t get rid of it the environmentalists can sue and then there’s going to have to be a trump clean power plan” said mr milloy who is also a former policy director for murray energy a major coal company whose chief executive robert e murray was a backer of mr trump’s campaign and his push to undo climate change policy the  legal finding is at the heart of a debate within the trump administration over how to permanently reverse mr obama’s climate change rules the finding concludes that carbon dioxide emissions endanger public health and welfare by warming the planet which led to a legal requirement that the e p a regulate smokestacks and tailpipes that spew   pollution thus climate policy experts on both sides of the debate say even if mr pruitt succeeds in the legally challenging process of withdrawing the clean power plan the endangerment finding will still put him under the legal obligation to put together a replacement regulation mr pruitt has told the white house and congress that he will not try to reverse the finding saying that such a move would almost certainly be overturned by the courts last month as mr trump prepared to release an executive order directing mr pruitt to dismantle the clean power plan along with nearly every other major element of mr obama’s climate change legacy mr pruitt argued against including a repeal of the endangerment finding in the order according to people familiar with the matter legal experts outside the trump white house say that while mr pruitt may face political fire on his right flank for the move it is nonetheless pragmatic legally since the finding has already been challenged and upheld by federal courts but mr pruitt is now being pilloried by conservative allies of the white house writing in breitbart news  —   the conservative website formerly run by mr trump’s senior strategist stephen k bannon  —   james delingpole a writer who is close to mr bannon said that if mr pruitt refused to undo the endangerment finding “it will represent a major setback for president trump’s war with the climate industrial complex ” “if scott pruitt is not up to that task then maybe it’s about time he did the decent thing and handed over the reins to someone who is” he added legal experts say they can see why opponents of climate change policy want to go after the endangerment finding  —   as long as it remains in place any efforts to undo climate regulations can always be reversed “as a matter of theory they’re absolutely right” said richard j lazarus a professor of environmental law at harvard “if you want to get rid of the climate stuff you get rid of the root not just the branches they want him to uproot the whole thing ” but mr lazarus added “as a matter of legal strategy it makes little sense because the endangerment finding is very strong ” the original recommendation to make an endangerment finding on carbon dioxide emissions was made by stephen l johnson a career scientist who led the e p a under president george w bush although the bush white house did not act on mr johnson’s memo after the obama administration did so the finding was legally challenged but upheld in a federal court the supreme court declined to hear an appeal mr lazarus said that mr pruitt would have his hands full with the legal challenges of undoing the regulations themselves taking on the endangerment finding would probably be futile he said “he doesn’t want to spend a lot of time with something that’s a sure loser” he said “it wrecks your credibility with the courts ” mr pruitt has a long history of championing legal efforts to undermine major environmental rules as oklahoma’s attorney general he sued the e p a  times in efforts to undo regulations he believes in stripping power away from the federal government and returning it to states but during his senate confirmation hearing he told senators that despite that he was likely to draw the line at trying to overturn the endangerment finding “it is there and it needs to be enforced and respected” mr pruitt said “there is nothing that i know that would cause it to be reviewed ”',\n",

       " 'battle over new bus terminal threatens to paralyze port authority’s board  the new york times after three years of planning for a new bus terminal in manhattan the commissioners of the port authority of new york and new jersey still agree that new york city badly needs one but as the nasty debate over paying for it has spilled out in public they appear to agree on little else the discord has threatened to paralyze the board that oversees the agency and that is responsible for transportation projects critical to the region when the time came on friday to publish the board’s monthly agenda the agency punted hinting that gov andrew m cuomo of new york a democrat might instruct his appointees not to conduct any business just as he did before the board’s previous meeting when the agenda for the meeting this week finally appeared on monday afternoon it suggested that politicians from the opposite sides of the hudson river had still not bridged their differences they may still be billions of dollars apart in their views on how the agency should spend the money it collects from tolls and transportation fees the battle over the bus terminal shows just how quickly the port authority can fall into the kind of dysfunction that allowed appointees of gov chris christie of new jersey a republican to spitefully close lanes at the george washington bridge in  mr christie has since stepped back from the agency but the tussle for influence over its vast finances has remained fierce it has caused at least one of mr cuomo’s associates to quit abruptly and has drawn in city and state officials from both states as well as representative jerrold nadler a manhattan democrat accusations of   bargaining have flown back and forth mr nadler went so far as to question the motivations of the agency’s chairman john j degnan and to call on him to recuse himself from deliberations over the bus terminal on monday mr nadler declined to discuss his allegation but he said of mr degnan “all i do know is that the new york people at the port authority and the governor’s people they all say that he’s been just dictatorial on everything ” angered by the attacks mr degnan a christie appointee has planted his feet and squared up for a fight “i am the chairman of the port authority” he said “the port authority needs to work with the governors but it should not be submissive to either one of them ” no decisions have been made about how or where to replace the    terminal a destination widely derided as forlorn and one that is overrun by over   daily commuters from new jersey and beyond but there is general agreement that the solution must include a new or revamped terminal within a few blocks of the existing one on eighth avenue in manhattan the crux of the current dispute is how much money the authority should commit to the project the commissioners have been wrestling all year with a revision of the agency’s   capital plan that budget drawn up in  did not include any money for the bus terminal facing cost estimates of   billion to   billion mr degnan has demanded that at least   billion of the capital plan be designated for the terminal but on tuesday richard azzopardi a spokesman for mr cuomo said the governor would agree to that only if at least   of the total was effectively contributed by new jersey “asking new yorkers to shoulder the burden of a  billion project many of them won’t ever use is a bad deal and a ” he said jameson w doig a professor emeritus at princeton who has chronicled the history of the port authority said he had been told that mr cuomo did not want his appointees to attend the board meeting in november while the dispute was unresolved one of them steve cohen who was the vice chairman of the board skipped the meeting and resigned mr cohen was the second cuomo appointee to depart in the last few months leaving the new york commissioners outnumbered six to four the previous vice chairman scott rechler left this fall mr doig said although there had been gridlock at the agency in the past he could not recall another instance of a governor’s asking commissioners to boycott a board meeting “we know that governor cuomo has been very interested in having substantial funds to carry out projects that he thinks are important” he said alluding to mr cuomo’s championing of an overhaul of la guardia airport “from his point of view the bus terminal is not one of them ” mr azzopardi said “the law provides that either governor can veto any action of the port authority so if someone wants to run the port authority they should run for governor ” mr nadler said he thought  billion was fair because the port authority was including the same amount in the capital plan for a project to build train tunnels under the hudson river known as gateway which is critical to improving travel in the region no draft of the revised capital plan has been released and the agency has not said how much would go for the gateway project steve coleman a spokesman for the agency said late on monday that he had no answers to questions about the capital plan it was not clear whether the commissioners would have answers when they gather for their monthly board meeting on thursday the delayed agenda indicated that they would vote on a resolution to publish a draft of the capital plan by dec  after that the resolution says the agency would invite the public to join in the debate over how it should spend more than  billion in capital funds public hearings will be held before any final decisions are made according to the resolution that is a very different process than the port authority has used in the past the authority adopted a policy of holding public hearings on its plans after ramming through an unpopular steep toll increase in  the public hearings are likely to draw crowds given the strong reactions to the agency’s previous decisions about the bus terminal new jersey officials fear the agency will decide to build a satellite depot in their state forcing many bus riders to transfer to path trains to reach manhattan residents of the hell’s kitchen neighborhood which surrounds the terminal fear eminent domain will be invoked to take private property for the project last week a group of new jersey officials gathered in hackensack n j to call for a commitment to fully fund a new terminal on the west side of manhattan that would preserve a   ride for commuters stephen m sweeney a new jersey democrat who is the president of the state senate said  billion would be too little to ensure that the project moved forward state senator loretta weinberg a bergen county democrat said  billion was “ not nearly enough to guarantee a commitment to the bus terminal ” ms weinberg said she thought that she and the new jersey officials had reached the framework of an agreement more than a month ago and was caught   when the debate turned hostile ms weinberg said she hoped “cooler heads will prevail” when the commissioners meet and try to wrap up the capital plan mr doig said he believed that the infighting was avoidable “the kind of severe political meddling that we’ve seen in the last six years is not inescapable” he said “you need to have governors who think about the important issues the region faces as opposed to thinking let’s find a way to use the port authority and its money to enhance my reputation ”',\n",

       " 'nuclear option fallout more extreme us justices experts say washington reuters  a republicanbacked senate rule change expected on thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme us supreme court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices experts said with a deep partisan divide in washington democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of president donald trump’s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch in the republicanled senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has threatened to change longstanding rules in the seat senate if the democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against supreme court nominees that would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a vote supermajority experts said the rule change called the “nuclear option” could produce an evermore ideologically polarized supreme court over the years with the senate narrowly divided the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party for the court the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees said stephen wermiel a supreme court scholar at the american university washington college of law “although it has not been widely used the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor” wermiel said  republican senator john mccain a defender of senate traditions warned of the consequences of the rule change though he said he would reluctantly support the move “we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right” mccain said “i do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary in fact i think the opposite will be true and americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law” republican senator lindsay graham said supreme court  nominees “are going to be more ideological not less” with the rule change which he warily supported the nuclear option would erase “the last shred of bipartisanship in the senate confirmation process” said senate democratic leader chuck schumer who led the filibuster against gorsuch elimination of the filibuster for supreme court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nineseat court after gorsuch who was nominated by trump to replace justice antonin scalia who died last year three current justices are  or older liberal ruth bader ginsburg is  conservative anthony kennedy who sometimes sides with the court’s liberals in big cases is  and liberal stephen breyer is  having more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law said university of massachusetts amherst political science professor paul collins coauthor of a book on supreme court confirmation hearings  if confirmed as expected on friday gorsuch would restore the court’s  conservative majority overturning the landmark  roe v wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees wermiel said without a filibuster a future democratic president with a democraticled senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left the result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be said brookings institution think tank expert russell wheeler said “an ideologicallydriven administration would eschew middleoftheroad judges” wheeler said “they would stack the court with ideological soulmates” trump advisor leonard leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process trump made it clear during the  presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential supreme court nominees that he made public and the voters elected trump leo said  “people knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president” leo said  ',\n",

       " 'did hillary insult sanderistas as ‘basement dwellers’ no—just the opposite the far left is up in arms again this time over a hacked tape of hillary clinton at a fundraiser in a wealthy virginia suburb\\n\\nthere i was watching college football and the ryder cup as my daughter sat next to me on the couch drawing rapunzel and ariel halftime of the game i was watching came so i moseyed over to my office to look in on the political world expecting not much new at\\xa0  o’clock on a saturday didn’t see much at first and then oh what’s this something about basement dwellers and hillary making fun of people living in basements what oh christ here we go again\\n\\nbackstory the intercept the i think it’s fair to say anticlintonthoughbynomeansprotrump web site got a tape\\xa0of a talk clinton gave at a private fundraiser in mclean virginia back in february no check that it looks like the washington free beacon got it first and posted it tuesday but the conservative beacon reflecting house priorities led with the fact that clinton evidently said on the tape that she wouldn’t upgrade the nuclear arsenal which for the beacon indicates of course that she wants america to lose\\n\\nafter that i’m not certain what happened but it seems as if after the beacon published the audio a couple intercept reporters were the first people on the left who got around to listening to it the intercept account as you might guess didn’t give a rat’s pooper about the nuclear arsenal but led with the fact that clinton said somewhat unfortunately—but in context only somewhat for reasons i’ll explain—that she occupies the “centerleft to the centerright”\\n\\nthat was a responsible and for the intercept predictable and understandable way to play the story but then by the time it got to the twittersphere clinton was somehow making fun of sanderistas mocking them for being such losers that they’re living in their parent’s basements the hashtag basementdwellers was trending like mad when i checked in and i’d imagine it’ll be going strong all night i read a few of them which boiled down to fuck you hillary you corporate hack this is why we need the revolution and you’re going to be the first to face the firing squad although i thought i smelled a lot of trolling from the deplorable caucus too\\n\\nof all the arrant bullshit i’ve seen on twitter this election this is easily the bullshittiest she insulted no one in fact quite the opposite—for someone speaking behind closed doors to ardent supporters she was not only restrained but she openly and directly asked her supporters to be patient with the impatient that is to understand the views and motivations of the younger people who wanted more radical change\\n\\nit is important to recognize what’s going on in this election everybody who’s ever been in an election that i’m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of on the one hand the kind of populist nationalist xenophobic discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the republican candidates and on the other side there’s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college free healthcare that what we’ve done hasn’t gone far enough and that we just need to you know \\xa0go as far as you know scandinavia whatever that means and half the people don’t know what that means but it’s something that they deeply feel so as a friend of mine said the other day i am occupying from the centerleft to the centerright and i don’t have much company there because it is difficult when you’re running to be president and you understand how hard the job is—i don’t want to overpromise i don’t want to tell people things that i know we cannot do\\n\\nsome are new to politics completely they’re children of the great recession and they are living in their parents’ basement they feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves and they don’t see much of a future i met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said “you know none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college and we don’t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance” so that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics and so if\\xa0you’re feeling like you’re consigned to you know being a barista or you know some other job that doesn’t pay a lot and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it then the idea that maybe just maybe you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing so i think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be you know a wet blanket on idealism we want people to be idealistic we want them to set big goals but to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals\\n\\nall right let’s parse them in the first quote the first sentence is just an opener and the second critiques the trump movement the third sentence critiques the sanders people but there’s nothing condescending in it maybe that “whatever that means” after the mention of scandinavia is a little dismissive but really now we’re at the point where we’re not permitting people speaking in private the occasional verbal tic of the sort we all employ\\n\\nthen comes centerleft and centerright it’s the mention of “centerright” that the intercept meant to rub in her face and in a perfect world i’d rather she’d not said it but it’s quite obvious that she is contrasting herself with the movements to her left and to her right—the very two movements she had just described so she was really just saying i’m in between those two and who knows—there were probably republicans in the room it was mclean she may have been trying to reassure them and get them to tell their friends “you know we can live with her” no that’s not pandering it’s politics if she weren’t chasing responsible republican votes she’d be an idiot\\n\\nnow the second and “offending” graf how in the world these words can offend anyone is just absurd ok baristas but i’m sure even most baristas have higher aspirations in life but the main thing is that when she says “they are living in their parents’ basement” she’s obviously not making fun of them she’s just describing them indeed she is explaining to these rich people in one of america’s richest towns hey take a minute to understand where these folks are coming from and she’s doing so the week after sanders throttled her in new hampshire—a point in time when if anything she’d have been prone to lash out at them\\n\\nthere’s nothing patronizing about any of this i also saw a bunch of people on twitter saying in effect for the life of me i don’t see what the big deal is here i retweeted a guy who said the basementdwellers “controversy” is proof enough of the reason why she didn’t release her speech transcripts amen to that',\n",

       " 'trump administration red tape tangles up visas for skilled foreigners data shows  washington reuters  the trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the united states challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the obama era according to data reviewed by reuters\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  the more intense scrutiny of the applications for hb visas comes after president donald trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highestpaid workers though he has not enacted any such reforms  data provided by us citizenship and immigration services shows that between jan  and aug  the agency issued  challenges or “requests for evidence” rfes to hb visa petitions  a  percent increase over the same period last year the total number of hb petitions rose by less than  percent in the same period  the challenges which can slow down the issuance of visas by months were issued at a greater rate in  than at any time in the obama administration except for one year  according to the uscis data which has not been previously reported  the trend is likely to cheer supporters of trump’s hardline stance on immigration they say visas for skilled foreigners undercut american workers by replacing them with lowpaid employees shipped in from abroad but major tech companies universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified americans  hb visas allow foreign workers generally with bachelors degrees or higher to work for three years at a time often in the technology healthcare and education sectors microsoft msfto amazon amzno google googlo apple aaplo intel intco oracle orcln and facebook fbo were heavy users of hb visas in  according to uscis data  the uscis inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas  to be sure the obama administration also issued a large number of hb challenges – nearly   from january through august  and a similar number in   immigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to highskilled employment visas but they say they are seeing a new trend in the trump era  in addition to querying applications more often the trump administration is targeting entrylevel jobs offered to skilled foreigners the lawyers say this violates the law governing hbs because it allows for visa holders to take entrylevel jobs  several attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entrylevel jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the hb program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by congress which could be debated and decided in the open  “one way to have an immigration policy that’s consistent with the policy that’s been articulated by the trump administration is to put more scrutiny on hb cases” said cyrus mehta a new yorkbased immigration attorney  uscis spokesman robert c langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in rfes this year in an email he said the agency is applying “currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions”  partners healthcare is a healthcare system that includes massachusetts general hospital and brigham and women’s hospital two prestigious teaching hospitals for harvard medical school it has received more than  rfes from uscis so far this year compared to fewer than  all of last year in response to a similar number of hb petitions said anthony pawelski an immigration attorney who handles hb applications for partners  uscis questioned the hospitals’ connection to the university even though their applications included proof of their nonprofit status a  agreement between harvard medical school and the hospitals and even text from the hospitals’ website referencing a year history with the university pawelski said  “they’re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudications and in their mind close any perceived loopholes” he said  langston declined to comment on specific hb petitions  it is still unclear how the increase in challenges will affect the number of visas issued this year in the  fiscal year uscis approved  percent of hb petitions by june  of this year the agency had approved  percent of hb petitions although that number is incomplete because it does not take into account the last three months of the  fiscal year when a large portion of hb applications are processed  both democratic and republican lawmakers have criticized hb visas because the biggest beneficiaries are outsourcing firms which critics say use the program to fill lowerlevel information technology jobs and replace american workers members of both parties have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa’s use  in an april executive order trump directed a review of the hb program aimed at ensuring the visas “are awarded to the mostskilled or highestpaid” applicants the order itself did not implement changes but directed agencies to suggest reforms  “what the trump administration has done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that companies are misusing the hb system” said russell harrison director of government relations at ieeeusa the american branch of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  the group opposes the hb program but supports giving more highskilled foreigners employmentbased permanent residence  many of the government challenges for visas for entrylevel jobs either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job does not count as a “specialty” occupation as required by the hb program according to a review of hundreds of rfes by the american immigration lawyers association provided to reuters  entrylevel jobs are positions for fresh university graduates with little or no work experience such jobs can pay “level ” wages the lowest of four tiers  “an rfe may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position” said langston the uscis spokesman  the uscis data did not specify what positions the rfes challenged or the reasons for the challenges  lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by uscis in the challenges  that specialty jobs cannot be entrylevel they point to young doctors and engineers for instance who may not have work experience but have spent years learning technical skills  though the challenges can come across all industries the aila review showed software developers and computer systems analysts were challenged more often than other jobs  silicon valley tech giants either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had been receiving more rfes  the requests can increase legal fees associated with each hb visa by as much as half attorneys said government fees for hb visas can run upwards of  and standard fees paid to lawyers per application can easily reach  or more  the increased costs and hassle could discourage employers from hiring such foreign workers especially at junior levels immigration lawyers said  jeffrey gorsky an attorney with berry appelman  leiden llp one of the largest corporate immigration firms in the country said one of the firm’s clients a midsized tech company was hit with six rfes from uscis in a single day this year  between late  and the end of  the company received just one rfe on an hb visa petition he said  ',\n",

       " '‘it had to be stopped’ heroes rise amid france terror attacks  the new york times nice france  —   terrorist attacks in france come often enough that they can seem to be variations on a painful pattern carnage followed by disbelief then condemnations condolences and shrines of flowers candles and letters for the dead yet to see the attacks only that way is to miss the one element that might buoy the national spirit in nearly every terrorist episode here ordinary individuals risked their own safety to try to halt the attack or to lend a hand to the wounded rather than running away some of these local heroes are recognized right away though others never receive recognition and some receive it only belatedly “what i saw was horrible people crushed  —   it had to be stopped” said a    man named franck who would not give his surname even after he was decorated by the city of nice for his effort to stop the driver of a cargo truck that ran over scores of people at a  bastille day celebration on july  a worker at the nice airport franck who was on a motor scooter decided in a split second to chase the truck and when he caught up rammed it  —   to no avail  —   and was knocked off he got up and ran after the truck managed to climb onto the running boards and began hitting the driver through the open window as the driver mohamed lahouaiej bouhlel tried to shoot franck his gun failed and at the same time franck tried to open the door of the truck then tried climbing through the window but the driver struck him on the head with the gun and he fell breaking a rib and badly bruising his back franck said he was satisfied that when the driver was fighting with him he was not running over more people “he was concentrating on me in that moment he could not kill people” he said at least two other men made similar if less prolonged efforts and also received medals from the city of nice alexander migues pursued the truck on a bicycle and gwenaël leriche a    deliveryman ran after the truck armed with nothing but a penknife and tried to jump onto the running boards as the truck came to a halt they were not unique almost every attack or attempted attack in france since the assault on the satirical magazine charlie hebdo on jan   produced local heroes there was lassana bathily a muslim immigrant from mali who hid shoppers in the basement of a kosher grocery store in paris two days after the charlie hebdo attack then smuggled them out as the terrorist amedy coulibaly held people hostage upstairs in villejuif in april last year a fitness instructor and mother aurélie châtelain  refused to hand over her car to sid ahmed ghlam who the authorities say planned to gun down a crowd at a suburban church her refusal ended with both of them being shot in a tussle and she died when mr ghlam called the police for help he was arrested he remains in prison and contends he did not shoot her ms châtelain received the légion d’honneur posthumously after her family and friends pointed out that if those who stopped a gunman presumed to be on the verge of an attack on the   thalys train running from amsterdam to paris deserved france’s highest award so did she the attempted attack on the train occurred almost exactly a year ago when a shirtless man emerged from a train bathroom with a kalashnikov assault rifle and a luger pistol three americans who  stopped him have been decorated by france’s president along with a briton and a   man mark moogalian who was the first to grab the gunman ayoub el khazzani mr moogalian was shot in the process but survived the intervention of the men stopped what could have become a slaughter on nov   when extremists tied to the islamic state attacked a theater a stadium and restaurants in and near paris a number of people made extraordinary efforts to help each other one was ludovic boumbas a    of congolese descent who lived in lille and was celebrating the birthday of a waitress at the   la belle équipe when armed men began firing on them he jumped in front of a young woman who was at the party and was fatally shot she was wounded but survived most recently in july sister danielle delafosse overcame her fear after  terrorists entered a small church at st    in rouen france with the intent to kill people she ran out of the church found someone with a phone and had the person call the police who arrived too late to save the rev jacques hamel  who was killed but perhaps in time to prevent more bloodshed while the heroism that gains attention is often the sort that risks the hero’s own life or limb many who acted in less visible ways nonetheless transcended the moment they responded with an extraordinary commitment to assist the wounded in circumstances that many would find overwhelming in nice they include doctors   technicians nurses and firefighters who worked hours upon hours treating the injured or trying to match lost children with their families there was also gilles thévenet the owner of the high club a popular discothèque in nice that faces the promenade des anglais who swiftly turned his nightclub into a triage center for emergency workers mr thévenet was sitting in his office in the back of the building oblivious to the bloody chaos as the cargo truck careened by until his security guards rushed in and he ran to the front door “we heard the weeping the cries we saw the crowds” he said “i understood i had to choose i could not open the door to the crowds of people and to those giving first aid i decided the first priority was the wounded to do as much as we could for the emergency responders who were trying to save whomever they could” he said in minutes the firefighters and   workers began carrying the injured  —   and the dead  —   into the club to get them off the promenade which was thick with running stumbling screaming people soon two medical helicopters landed just in front of the disco where the aid workers performed triage with the most badly hurt airlifted to hospitals nearby some of mr thévenet’s security staff who were trained in first aid worked alongside the firefighters and emergency responders a room in the club was set aside for the dead mr thévenet is not sure when  —   or even if  —   business will return especially because many in nice know that the dead and wounded lay in rows on the same floor where they would be dancing but he believes it will “we will have to find again the party atmosphere that has been our protein for  years” he said “it is out of the question to cede it to the terrorists ” a few blocks farther west on the promenade in sight of the sea stands the ultramodern lenval foundation hospital one of only two major pediatric centers in southern france and the place where dr virginie rampal a pediatric orthopedist who was born and raised in nice works day in and day out to mend the bones of children she was   the night of the attack but at home after a relatively quiet day she had considered going with her daughters to the promenade to see the fireworks but her plans changed when a friend stopped by when dr rampal’s pager went off like everyone else she did not know of the attack but rushed to the emergency room the wounded were already filling the chairs lying on the floor some with open fractures  —   most of them children more were coming in some carried in their parents’ arms she helped with triage went into surgery back to triage working without stopping as  young patients many under the age of  were stabilized and sent into surgery of the

       " 'boom or bust stark partisan divide on how consumers view economy  the new york times economics has a foundation in hard numbers  —   employment inflation spending  —   that has largely allowed it to sidestep the competing partisan narratives that have afflicted american politics and culture but not anymore since donald j trump’s victory in november consumer sentiment has diverged in an unprecedented way with republicans convinced that a boom is at hand and democrats foreseeing an imminent recession “we’ve never recorded this before” said richard curtin who directs the university of michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment although the outlook has occasionally varied by political party since the survey began in  “the partisan divide has never had as large an impact on consumers’ economic expectations” he said at the same time familiar economic data points have become rorschach tests that was evident after the government’s monthly jobs report on friday republicans’ talking points centered on a   low in the unemployment rate while democrats focused on a sharp decline in job creation “i find it stunning to be honest it’s unreal” said michael r strain director of economic policy studies at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington “things that were less politicized in the past like how you feel about the economy have become more politicized now ” indeed the    views underscore yet another front on which americans remain polarized five months after the election and with president trump nearing his th day in office there are some tangible reasons for the split many republican states including the midwestern swing states that provided mr trump’s margin of victory have experienced a more sluggish recovery over the last eight years  —   and are thus more invested in the change promised by mr trump many democratic states have bounced back more vigorously hence their political and economic viewpoints were jolted by november’s election result for example vermont colorado and massachusetts  —   all carried by the democrats  —   are thriving with an unemployment rate below  percent in republican strongholds like alaska georgia and alabama the rate is well above the national average of   percent    republicans aren’t the only ones who are feeling more upbeat whether or not it’s justified by the data sentiment among business leaders who backed mr trump has also surged since the election david congdon chief executive of old dominion freight line the trucking giant never expected mr trump to win when he voted for him in november “i fell out of bed when i got up in the morning on nov ” he admitted “i didn’t quite know what i was voting for ” but despite misfires in washington like the failed attempt to roll back president barack obama’s health care policies mr congdon is definitely feeling more positive “trump’s got a hard road ahead of him but i think he’s off to a decent start” said mr congdon who recently joined other transportation executives for a meeting with mr trump and vice president mike pence “i’m personally optimistic about the economy for the rest of the year and i think we will see an uptick in terms of freight deliveries” he said “we have picked up our hiring ” economists too find their outlook shifting with the political landscape before the election heather boushey a top adviser to hillary clinton during the campaign thought “the economy was on the right track with slow and steady growth like we’ve had over the past few years ” now she is much more pessimistic especially about the economy’s   prospects although she is pleased that the affordable care act survived republican efforts to repeal it the gridlock has led her to believe that mr trump will never get a big infrastructure spending package through congress “i am losing hope that we will make those   investments over the next few years” said ms boushey executive director of the liberal center for equitable growth the university of michigan researchers have their own way of measuring the gulf between the two viewpoints and how quickly it has flipped among republicans the michigan consumer expectations index was at   in october the kind of reading typically reported in the depths of a recession confident that mrs clinton would win democrats registered a   reading close to the highs reached when her husband was in office in the late s and the economy was soaring by march the positions were reversed with an even more extreme split republicans’ expectations had soared to   equivalent to levels registered in boom times as for democrats they were even more pessimistic than republicans had been in october as at the voting booth the split in perceptions could have   consequences if behavior tracks the   sentiment among democrats who account for  percent of respondents in the survey prophecies could quickly become   by affecting spending and investing decisions “if   of the population cut their consumer spending by  percent you get a recession” said alan blinder a princeton economist who served in the clinton administration and advised al gore and hillary clinton on economic policy during their democratic presidential campaigns “i don’t think it will happen but it’s not beyond the realm of the possible ” to be sure even if democratic consumers pulled back that wouldn’t necessarily bring on a recession a burst of spending by bullish republicans who equal  percent of those polled by the michigan researchers could counteract much of that drag and independents who are the largest cohort in the survey at  percent remain fairly optimistic about future growth it is rare for “rising optimism to coexist with increasing uncertainty” said mr curtin the michigan expert “the current level of optimism clearly indicates that no economywide spending retrenchment is underway but the prevailing level of uncertainty will limit growth in discretionary spending ” lawrence h summers who served as treasury secretary under president bill clinton and was mr obama’s chief economic adviser during his first term said he too was struck by the big swing in economic sentiment “it is a remarkably big switch from october” he said “if you are a democrat you are primed for negativity it carries through in your view of everything else ” a prominent democrat himself and a strong hillary clinton backer mr summers is nonetheless slightly more optimistic than he was late last year because the data on housing starts and business investment intentions has been positive not because of the new administration’s policies whether the optimists or pessimists prove more prescient about the economy’s trajectory mr summers said the split in perceptions will persist “i’d bet there will be some minor convergence” he said “but there will still be a large divergence on what should be a matter of objective reality ”',\n",

       " 'agencies clashed on classification of clinton email inquiry shows  the new york times washington  —   documents released monday in the hillary clinton email investigation show intense disagreement last year between the state department and the f b i over whether some of mrs clinton’s emails should be considered classified including a discussion of a possible “quid pro quo” to settle one dispute the new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case a senior state department official patrick f kennedy pressed the f b i to agree that one of mrs clinton’s emails on the  benghazi attack would be unclassified  —   and not classified as the bureau wanted what remained unclear from the documents was whether it was mr kennedy or an f b i official who purportedly offered the “quid pro quo” marking the email unclassified in exchange for the state department’s approving the posting of more f b i agents to iraq officials at both the f b i and the state department said monday that no deal had been struck or even offered over the classification of mrs clinton’s private emails they noted that the benghazi email in question had been made public with a sentence blocked out meeting the f b i ’s demand for classification they also said no additional f b i agents had been posted overseas there is no indication from the documents that mrs clinton was aware of the discussion donald j trump and other republicans nonetheless quickly seized on the new documents as evidence of what speaker paul d ryan called “a   ” the f b i ’s latest release of  pages of internal investigative files prolonged the intense public scrutiny of mrs clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state which has been perhaps more damaging to her presidential campaign than any other issue the new documents also cast particular attention on the role of mr kennedy a state department civil servant for more than four decades in working to oversee the review and public release of tens of thousands of mrs clinton’s private emails one of the f b i reports said state department employees who reviewed nearly  of mrs clinton’s emails on the benghazi attacks in early  in response to requests from congress had “felt intense pressure” from mr kennedy and other senior state department officials to complete their review quickly and “not label anything as classified ” mr kennedy was part of a   battle between the state department and the intelligence agencies over mrs clinton’s emails as the emails were prepared for release officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified while state department officials countered that they contained the routine business of american diplomacy state department officials who argue that the intelligence agencies are overzealous in classifying information remain sensitive to criticism that they were sloppy in handling the material in one of the newly disclosed documents an unidentified f b i employee told investigators that mr kennedy through another f b i official had sought in one case “assistance in altering the email’s classification in exchange for a ‘quid pro quo ’” the f b i had deemed the email classified but the state department disagreed the employee told investigators that “in exchange for marking the email unclassified state would reciprocate by allowing the f b i to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden” according to the f b i ’s summary of the employee’s questioning by investigators a second f b i interview included in the documents provides a somewhat different version of the dispute over the classification of the benghazi email with the suggestion that the f b i  —   and not mr kennedy  —   had offered to make a deal in the interview an unidentified f b i official in the international operations division said mr kennedy had complained to him that the f b i classification of the document “caused problems for kennedy” and that mr kennedy had wanted to give it a different designation and file it in the state department basement  —   “never to be seen again ” the unidentified f b i official said he was the one who then “told kennedy he would look into the email matter if kennedy would provide authority concerning the f b i ’s request to increase its personnel in iraq ” the email they were struggling over was sent on nov   by william v roebuck who oversaw the department’s office for north africa and is now the american ambassador to bahrain in it he notified five other officials of the arrest of “several people” in libya on suspicion they were connected with the benghazi attack two months earlier it was subsequently forwarded to senior officials at the department and then to mrs clinton on her private email account by her deputy chief of staff jake sullivan with a short “f y i ” note mark c toner a state department spokesman said that no favors had been exchanged in the discussions of mrs clinton’s emails and that there had been no change in the number of agents in iraq as a result of the conversations “the allegation of any kind of quid pro quo is inaccurate and does not align with the facts” mr toner said the f b i also said there was “never a quid pro quo” but it said the accusations had been referred to the bureau’s inspection division which handles internal ethics issues to investigate the f b i official who discussed the issue with mr kennedy has since left the bureau an official said one of mr trump’s foreign policy advisers michael t flynn a retired general who headed the defense intelligence agency said the documents provided “undeniable proof” that mrs clinton had “colluded with the f b i d o j and state department to cover up criminal activity at the highest levels ” two prominent members of the house  —   jason chaffetz of utah the chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform and devin nunes of california the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence  —   called on secretary of state john kerry to relieve mr kennedy of his position pending an investigation

consulting directly with the justice department and bypassing the f b i ’s input a spokesman for mr trump’s campaign jason miller said mr kennedy should resign mr toner said mr kennedy would remain in his position with the full support of mr kerry after the email issue emerged in march  mrs clinton insisted for months that she had never sent or received emails that contained classified information

       " 'trumps popularity is slipping in rural america poll reuters  outside the morgan county fair in mcconnelsville in a rural swath of ohio that fervently backed us president donald trump in last year’s election ticket seller john wilson quietly counts off a handful of disappointments with the man he helped elect  the yearold retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the white house he does not like trump’s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts he wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system and he worries that trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country  “every president makes mistakes” wilson said “but if you add one on top of one on top of another one on top of another there’s just a limit”  trump who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like morgan county has been losing his grip on rural america  according to the reutersipsos daily tracking poll the republican president’s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where  percent of the country’s population lives the poll of more than  adults in “nonmetro” areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of trump as they are to approve of him  in september  percent of people in nonmetro areas approved of trump while  percent disapproved that is down from trump’s first four weeks in office when  percent said they approved of the president while  percent disapproved  the poll found that trump has lost support in rural areas among men whites and people who never went to college he lost support with rural republicans and rural voters who supported him on election day  and while trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security rural americans are increasingly unhappy with trump’s record on immigration a central part of his presidential campaign  fortyseven percent of rural americans said in september they approved of the president’s handling of immigration down from  percent during his first month in office  poll respondents who were interviewed by reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration  a few said they are tired of waiting for trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along america’s southern border while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration’s efforts to restrict travel into the united states  “there should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that’s more controlled” said drew carlson  of warrensburg missouri who took the poll  but trump’s “constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me”  the trump administration would not comment about the reutersipsos poll\\xa0  \\xa0  to be sure trump is still much more popular in rural america than he is elsewhere  since he took office “i like him less but i support him more” said robert cody  a retired chemical engineer from bartlesville oklahoma who took the poll  cody said that trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border  when trump called the election a “last shot” for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation’s southern border with a “big fat beautiful wall” he was speaking directly to rural america said david swenson an economist at iowa state university  “feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places” swenson said “and here comes a candidate trump who’s offering simplistic answers” to issues that concern them  rural americans responded by supporting trump over democratic rival hillary clinton by  percentage points during the election an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states such as michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania where trump won by less than  percentage point  but after  months many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural america said karl stauber who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central virginia  “rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are” stauber said “they’ve heard so many promises and they’ve not seen much done”  despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region or anyone expand their workforce due to new federal policies  “it just seems like we’ve dropped off the screen” he said\\xa0  according to the poll trump’s overall popularity has dropped gradually and for different reasons this year  rural americans were increasingly unhappy with trump’s handling of healthcare in march and april after he lobbied for a republican plan to overhaul obamacare and cut coverage for millions of americans  in may and june they were more critical of trump’s ability to carry out us foreign policy and they gave him lower marks for “the way he treats people like me”  in

       " 'donald trump’s description of black america is offending those living in it  the new york times atlanta  —   demeitrus williams has heard what donald j trump has been saying recently about black people that their neighborhoods were “war zones ” that they struggle to get by on food stamps that they see nothing but failure around them mr williams  a retired postal employee who is   acknowledged that mr trump’s remarks described a reality for some black people but it was not his reality or that of people he knew and the fact that those generalizations in which all   inhabit a hell of violence and dysfunction came as part of an outreach effort on mr trump’s part elicited from mr williams an incredulous and slightly bitter cascade of chuckles “who’s he talking about” mr williams said wednesday over lunch at ponce city market an upscale development with a hip food court that draws an ethnically and racially mixed crowd “i don’t know  —   most of the black people i know are educated and live in nice neighborhoods everybody in my family is required to have a degree ” dogged by suggestions that he has been running a racist campaign mr trump has been expressing concern for   more in the past week than at any other point in his presidential run and making a direct appeal for their votes “what do you have to lose” he has asked but the unrelievedly dire picture he has painted of black america has left many black voters angry dumbfounded or both interviews with roughly a dozen blacks here turned up no one who found any appeal in mr trump’s remarks more common was the suggestion that mr trump was trying to appeal to whites who might support him “i hear him not talking to black people but talking to white people about black people so they will think he cares about black people” said alexis scott a former publisher of the atlanta daily world a   newspaper “the real thing that he’s trying to do is to try to protect some of the white vote by suggesting to them that he cares ” speaking invariably to almost   audiences mr trump has portrayed blacks as living lives of utter desperation “what do you have to lose by trying something new like trump” he asked a crowd in virginia on saturday “you’re living in your poverty your schools are no good you have no jobs  percent of your youth is unemployed  —   what the hell do you have to lose” marc morial the president of the national urban league said that black americans faced challenges but that mr trump’s depiction of a hopeless violent black america did not match reality “it’s an inaccurate portrayal of the community that seeks to define the community by only its biggest challenges” mr morial said “black america has deep problems  —   deep economic problems  —   but black america also has a large community of striving successful   people college educated in the work force ” poverty is far more prevalent in black households than the general population but the vast majority of   do not live in poverty according to census data released last year  percent of blacks live in poverty compared with  percent of the country as a whole only about one out of every four households receiving food stamps in  was black according to the united states department of agriculture one area where blacks lag severely is homeownership rates of homeownership for blacks have dipped over the past four years to   percent in the second quarter of this year the lowest rate among any racial group according to the census bureau the unemployment rate for blacks is nearly double the national average mr trump’s tone and strategy in courting the black vote is distinctly different from that of previous republican presidential nominees whose more formal outreach efforts had limited success in  for instance president george w bush addressed the national urban league and in  mitt romney appeared before the n a a c p “someone like george w bush to his credit actually went to black audiences with people who had real connections to black communities” said matthew b platt a political scientist at historically black morehouse college “he actually made those kinds of connections to then filter down to regular black people trump is not doing anything of that sort ” but he noted that mr trump’s basic presentation to black voters was perhaps not altogether different from the one he has made to white voters “it seems to me that trump’s argument is this ‘your life sucks try something new i’m something new’” he said “that’s the argument he’s making to black voters and more broadly that’s the entire trump campaign ” mr trump would seem to have nowhere to go but up among   voters a recent nbc   street journal poll found hillary clinton with a  to  percent advantage over mr trump among blacks many say mr trump’s role in leading the   birther movement that questioned president obama’s birthplace doomed his chances with   voters “social media and youtube have a record of what he’s said in the last year much less the last five or six years” said andra gillespie an emory university political scientist who is black “you can’t just make one speech have a good week and then all of a sudden think people are going to forget everything you’ve done ” some black conservatives however defended mr trump wayne dupree a radio host posted a live video to periscope an app that allows users to   video saying that mrs clinton had been tricking black people for years he urged blacks to look at the conditions they were living under “look to the left look to the right and look in front of you and tell me if things haven’t changed” he said “then why do you keep voting for the democratic party why do you keep voting for the same side” he urged blacks to help get mr trump “elected so that we can change america ”’ “america needs to go a different route” mr dupree said the trump campaign rejected criticism with a statement from lynne patton a black woman who is an assistant to the trump family accusing democrats of treating black voters as a “monolith ” in atlanta on wednesday nate cohen  a health care information technology worker was among the   unimpressed by mr trump’s efforts mr cohen’s most generous interpretation was that perhaps mr trump had not done his homework perhaps he needed to hit the streets and see the variety of the black experience “i don’t recall ever seeing him going out into those hedges and highways” he said “you can’t just go on what you see on tv ” certainly he said some live in dire poverty mr cohen’s side job is as a motivational speaker work that takes him to troubled neighborhoods but he said blacks and latinos were not the only people living in such conditions he said he had tried to give mr trump a fair hearing but had been turned off to him long ago mr trump he said will say “warped” things  —   like proposing to bar muslims from entering the country or deporting all illegal immigrants  —   and then say things to “patch it up ” he wondered whether mr trump was appealing to whites reinforcing stereotypes about blacks “you’ve got to be mindful of who you affect and who you infect” he said adding that mr trump might be “infecting” his white audience with racist ideas or as ms scott put it “he is giving voice to every stereotype he’s ever heard i heard someone say ‘it’s like he only watches “the wire” and that’s what he knows about black people ’” at six feet under a seafood restaurant popular among blacks and whites anthony simpson  said he had heard mr trump’s comments but paid them little mind he said he had long dismissed mr trump as “a joke ” mr simpson who owns a demolition business said he was not surprised that mr trump had offended many black people after the things he had said about muslims and latinos “he eventually was going to get around to it” he said',\n",

media portrays the new cold war as “whitehatted” americans standing up to “blackhatted” russians to stop aggression against nato and to save children in syria but the reality is much more gray says excia analyst ray mcgovern \\nhow did the “growing trust” that russian president vladimir putin once said marked his “working and personal relationship with president obama ” change into today’s deep distrust and saberrattling \\ntheir relationship reached its zenith after mr putin persuaded syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction enabling mr obama at the last minute to call off with some grace plans to attack syria in late summer  \\nbut at an international conference in the russian black sea resort of sochi last week mr putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented “my personal agreements with the president of the united states have not produced results” he complained about “people in washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and referring to syria decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations enormous effort and difficult compromises” jpg president barack obama addresses the united nations general assembly’s seventyfirst session on sept   un photo \\na month earlier russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  who chooses his words carefully told russian tv viewers “my good friend john kerry … is under fierce criticism from the us military machine despite mr kerry’s assurances that the us commander in chief president barack obama supported him in his contacts with russia he confirmed that during his meeting with president vladimir putin apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief” \\ndo not chalk this up to paranoia the usled coalition air strikes on known syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the september ceasefire — not to mention statements at the time by the most senior us generals — were evidence enough to convince the russians that the pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with russia \\na new nadir \\nrelations between the us and russian presidents have now reached a nadir and mr putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet jpg russian president vladimir putin addresses un general assembly on sept   un photo \\non oct  ministry spokesman maj gen igor konashenkov said russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft — including any stealth aircraft — over syria and warned ominously that russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft \\nit seems possible that the us air force will challenge that claim in due course — perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the white house last week national intelligence director and former air force general james clapper commented offhandedly “i wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft … if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground” \\ninjecting additional volatility into the equation major news outlets are playing down or ignoring russia’s warnings thus americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if russian air defenses down a us or coalition aircraft \\nmeanwhile in europe as nato defense ministers met in brussels on wednesday defense secretary ashton carter told reporters the us is contributing “a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team” as a “major sign of the us commitment to strengthening deterrence here” \\n“this was a decision made by the alliance leaders in warsaw” he explained referring to nato’s july summit meeting in the polish capital “the united states will lead a battalion in poland and deploy an entire battleready battalion task force of approximately  soldiers from the nd cavalry regiment which is based in germany” \\non thursday at the valdai conference in the russian black sea resort of sochi president putin accused the west of promoting the “myth” of a “russian military threat” calling this a “profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets … expand nato and bring its infrastructure military units and arms closer to our borders” \\nmyth or not german foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on russia’s borders will bring less regional security mr steinmeier warned against “saberrattling” adding that “we are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation” \\nspeaking of such pretexts it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in eastwest tensions over the past twoandahalf years originally stemmed from the westernsponsored coup d’état in kiev on feb   and russia’s reaction in annexing crimea americans malnourished on the diet served up by “mainstream” media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup youtube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between us assistant secretary of state victoria nuland and the us ambassador in kiev during which “yats” for arseniy yatsenyuk was identified as washington’s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in kiev \\nthis unique set of circumstances prompted george friedman president of the thinktank stratfor to label the putsch in kiev on feb   “really the most blatant coup in history” \\nit’s time for western

       " 'is the fbi constitutional email \\ndirector of the federal bureau of investigation fbi james comey is again under fire this time by supporters of hillary clinton for permitting the reopening of the investigation into her use of personal servers to store and send classified material the second round of a scandal that could prove fatal to the democratic nominees chance to occupy the oval office in january \\nrepublicans had their own go at comey when he declared after the original investigation of clintons mishandling of classified documents and information that there was insufficient evidence to charge her with any criminal violation \\ncomey it seems has become a punching bag being worked over by partisans on both sides of the political aisle \\nregarding the sound and fury coming out of the clinton camp they dont see that their candidate has fallen into a pit she dug for herself she knew or should have known that there are rules governing the treatment and transmission of data that could place us national security in danger \\nshe broke those rules and despite what comey claimed whether she did so knowingly or not is irrelevant as the requisite mental state codified into the regulation is negligence that is to say in order to be in violation of the relevant statute one need only fail to take reasonable care in the behavior in question \\nit is beyond dispute that there was a duty of care and hillary clintons behavior fell well below that bar \\nwhat is also beyond dispute is that neither the republicans — when clinton was exonerated — or the democrats — when the whole affair was brought back into the light of investigation — ever questioned the authority of the fbi to carry on as a federal police force \\nthe larger question the constitutional question is why does the federal government have an armed police force with nearly unlimited authority at home and abroad and with the power to conduct most of its work in secret beyond the oversight of the american people whose interest they ostensibly serve \\nperhaps ryan mcmaken has hit upon the answer to that question in an article published on the mises wire blog mcmaken writes of the federal governments law enforcement agency of all federal police forces the fbi is the most romanticized and every fbi agent is assumed to be the modern embodiment of a fictionalized version of eliot ness incorruptible professional and efficient decades of pop culture has driven this home with tv series and movies such as the untouchables  the fbi story  and this is your fbi have long perpetuated the idea that when local police fail the fbi will step in to be more effective and simply better than every other law enforcement agency corruption cannot touch the fbi we are told and they apply the law equally to everyone \\naccording to a piece penned in  a stasi for america reporter james bovard painted a darker less egalitarian picture of the fbis application of the law a ripple of protest swept across the internet in late march after the disclosure that the federal bureau of investigation was teaching its agents that “the fbi has the ability to bend or suspend the law to impinge on the freedom of others” this maxim was inculcated as part of fbi counterterrorism training the exposure of the training material — sparked by a series of articles by wiredcom’s spencer ackerman — spurred the ritual declaration by an fbi spokesman that “mistakes were made and we are correcting those mistakes” no fbi officials were sanctioned or fired for teaching lawmen that they were above the law at least the fbi has been consistent since its founding in  the bureau has rarely let either the statute book or the constitution impede its public service tim weiner the author of a superb exposé of the cia  legacy of ashes  has delivered a riveting chronology of some of the fbi’s biggest crimes with his new book enemies  \\ntheres no question that in its roughly  years of existence the fbi has seen its reputation rise and fall \\nmcmaken recites a bit of recent history in support of his assertion that the creation and the continuation of the fbi as a federal secret police force is an assault on the liberty of the united states the reality and the romance of course have always been two totally different things and its helpful to remind ourselves that it was the fbi that was in charge of the waco massacre where  children were killed it was the fbi that led the raid on randy weavers house where an fbi sniper shot a woman dead while she was holding a month old baby it was the fbi that spied on martin luther king jr and targeted peaceful antiwar organizations for political reasons during the s and s it was the fbi that came of age arresting opponents of the first world war naturally in all of these cases the fbi has actively covered up the facts and denied wrongdoing \\nnext the history lesson looks further back to the beginnings of the fbi to illuminate the transformation of the fbi from crimefighting force albeit no less unconstitutional to powerful partner in the surveillance state thanks to war hysteria during world war i the fbi rose to prominence as woodrow wilsons shock troops against dissidents ie peaceful opponents of the war indeed persecuting and prosecuting political enemies of the american state would become something of the forte of the fbi with the role of the agency being expanded ever more during times of perceived national crisis the idea of the fbi as a crimefighting organization — the primary message of fawning treatments of the fbi such as the untouchables and the fbi story — for decades served as cover for the fbis political activities as foreign policy pointed out in  though the fbi quietly dropped its claims of being a crime fighting organization and began declaring itself a national security organization down the memory hole goes the fbis original claimed raison detre \\nthis point is borne out in the fbis own description of its purpose on the questions and answers section of its official web page the agency describes itself as an intelligencedriven and threatfocused national security organization with both intelligence and law enforcement responsibilities \\nwhere one wonders does the constitution grant the federal government or any of its associated agencies any intelligence gathering and federal lawenforcement power \\nfinally not only is the fbis assumption of its current role as federal police force and armed branch of the federal surveillance apparatus unconstitutional and a persistent threat to freedom but it represents yet another example of the inability of the government to perform any task on par with a privately owned entity with the same or similar objective again from the mises wire the unreliability of metropolitan police with their strong local and partisan ties prompted major businesses and industrialists to establish the pinkertons and other private police forces the pinkertons ultimately functioned as a de facto national detective and policing service until the s when the fbi finally came into its own \\nas one scandal blends into the next and as each generation sees the

       " 'hillary isnt winning over many pundits even on the left hillary clinton is clobbering bernie sanders—and yet getting negative reviews from some of the pundits\\n\\nhow is that possible the democratic race is essentially over president obama is privately telling donors it’s time to get on the hillary train the new york times reports a frontrunner who wins in state after state usually basks in a winner’s aura as the party coalesces around her and draws glowing profiles of how she and her team did it\\n\\nsure hillary was always expected to beat bernie it’s also true that clinton has never been beloved by the press and the feeling is mutual\\n\\nbut the larger problem is the outlook as the commentary class looks ahead to the fall\\n\\nuntil the last couple of weeks the conventional wisdom was that a trump nomination would all but assure a second clinton presidency after all she’s the former senator and secretary of state with an awesome political machine and he’s the untested billionaire with a penchant for divisive rhetoric plus democrats have an electoral college edge and have won the popular vote in five of the last six campaigns\\n\\nbut some commentators see troubling signs in clinton’s performance so far and wonder how she would withstand a trump onslaught the donald has high negatives to be sure but hillary does as well\\n\\nan unsparing assessment comes from joe klein who has known the clintons for a quarter century and mostly written sympathetically about them since his  new york magazine cover story on bill clinton\\n\\nklein agrees with hillary’s selfassessment that she is not a natural politician but goes much further in weighing a trump matchup\\n\\n“clinton seems particularly ill equipped for the task she is our very own quinoa and kale salad nutritious but bland worse she’s the human embodiment of the establishment that trump has been running against…\\n\\n“indeed her real problem is that she’s too much of a politician she still speaks like politicians did  years ago when her husband was president this year the candidates who have seemed the most appealing–trump sanders john kasich–don’t use the oratorical switchbacks that have been beaten to death since john f kennedy”\\n\\nit’s no secret that sanders has pushed clinton to the left on trade immigration wall street and other issues but klein says that is often viewed as dissembling\\n\\n“there is an odd new law of us politics you can lie as trump does all the time egregiously but you can’t temporize you can’t avoid a position on the xl pipeline or the transpacific trade deal as clinton tried to do in the campaign you can’t try to please too many people too much of the time raising your voice to make a point–which clinton does all the time disastrously because it seems such a conscious act–won’t get you anywhere unless you’re really angry\\n\\n“in the end i’m not at all certain that clinton can beat trump”\\n\\na note about her speaking style when clinton won five states on tuesday night i tweeted that she was shouting her speech and that it would be more effective with the audience at home if she was more conversational i didn’t say she was shrill i didn’t say she should smile and in the past i’ve criticized sanders for shouting his way through debates\\n\\nbut i was hit with hundreds of tweets declaring me to be a horrible misogynistic sexist some of this was a wave powered by what others had said about her speech maybe my quick take was wrong but i hope we’re not entering a period where any criticism of the presumptive democratic nominee is treated as sexism\\n\\nother leftwing pundits driven in part by ideology fear the worst this salon headline boils it down\\n\\n“hillary will never survive the trump onslaught it’s not fair but it makes her a weak nominee”\\n\\nclinton’s largest problem in my view is her low polling marks on honesty a result of the email scandal and perhaps decades of scars of accumulated accusations some of them fair and some exaggerated\\n\\nveteran journalist jeff greenfield writing earlier in politico spells out three reasons why clinton could prove to be a weak candidate\\n\\n“first hillary clinton commands little trust among an electorate that is driven today by mistrust second her public life—the posts she has held the positions she has adopted and jettisoned—define her as a creature of the ‘establishment’ at a time when voters regard the very idea with deep antipathy and finally however she wishes it were not so however much she argues that she represents the future as america’s first prospective female president\\n\\nclinton still embodies the past just as she did in  when she lost to barack obama the combination of those three factors is already playing out in the democratic primary where younger voters are turning away from her and embracing a geriatric whitehaired alternative in droves”\\n\\nwhen clinton recalibrates says greenfield “she always embraces the politically popular stand”\\n\\nhowever lukewarm the democratic base may be about hillary she enjoys broad support within the party and most bernie backers should have no trouble shifting their allegiance to her the same can’t be said for trump who is weathering a republican revolt against the likelihood of his winning the nomination\\n\\nwe’ll know hillary is solving her enthusiasm problem when she starts getting better reviews from journalists on the left\\n\\nhoward kurtz is a fox news analyst and the host of mediabuzz sundays  am and  pm et he is the author of

from their candidate donald trump but because of his personal behaviour according to thierry meyssan until now the united states was composed of migrants from different horizons who accepted to submit to the ideology of a particular community  this is the model which is in the process of breaking down at the risk of shattering the country itself during the year of the us electoral campaign that we have just weathered the rhetoric has profoundly changed and an unexpected rift has appeared between the two camps if in the beginning the candidates spoke about subjects which were genuinely political such as the sharing of wealth or national security today they are mostly talking about sex and money it is this dialogue and not the political questions which has caused the explosion of the republican party – whose main leaders have withdrawn their support for their candidate – and which is recomposing the political chessboard awakening an ancient cleavage of civilisation on one side mrs clinton is working to appear politically correct while on the other «the donald» is blowing the hypocrisy of the ex«first lady» to smithereens \\non one side hillary clinton promises male  female equality – although she has never hesitated to attack and defile the women who revealed that they had slept with her husband – and that she is presenting herself not for her personal qualities but as the wife of an expresident and that she accuses donald trump of misogyny because he does not hide his appreciation of the female gender on the other donald trump denounces the privatisation of the state and the racketing of foreign personalities by the clinton foundation to obtain appointments with the state department – the creation of obamacare not in the interest of citizens but for the profit of medical insurance companies – and goes as far as to question the honesty of the electoral system \\ni am perfectly aware that the way in which donald trump expresses himself may encourage racism but i do not believe for a second that this question is at the heart of the electoral debate despite the hype from the proclinton medias it is not without interest that during the lewinsky affair president bill clinton apologised to the nation and convened a number of preachers to pray for his salvation but when he was accused of similar misconduct by an audio recording donald trump simply apologised to the people he had upset without making any appeal to members of the clergy the current divide reawakens the revolt of catholic orthodox and lutheran values against those of the calvinists mainly represented in the usa by the presbyterians the baptists and the methodists \\nwhile the two candidates were raised in the puritan tradition clinton as a methodist and trump as a presbyterian mrs clinton has returned to the religion of her father and participates today in a prayer group composed of the army chiefs of staff the family while mr trump practises a more interior form of spirituality and rarely goes to church of course noone is locked into the systems in which they were raised but when people act without thinking they unconsciously reproduce these systems the question of the religious environment of the candidates may therefore be important \\nin order to understand the stakes of this game we have to go back and look at th century england oliver cromwell instigated a military coup d’etat which overthrew king charles st he wanted to install a republic purify the soul of the country and ordered the decapitation of the exsovereign he created a sectarian régime inspired by the ideas of calvin massacred thousands of irish papists and imposed a puritan way of life he also created zionism – he invited the jews back to england and was the first head of state in the world to demand the creation of a jewish state in palestine this bloody episode is known by the name of the «first british civil war» \\nafter the monarchy had been reinstated cromwell’s puritans fled from england they set up in holland from where some of them left for the americas aboard the mayflower the «pilgrim fathers» while others founded the afrikaner community in south africa during the war of independence in the th century the united states we saw a resurgence of the struggle of the calvinists against the british monarchy so that in current manuals of british history it is known as the «second civil war» \\nin the th century the american civil war opposed the southern states mainly inhabited by catholic colonists to the north mostly inhabited by protestant colonists the history of the winning side presents this confrontation as a fight for freedom in the face of slavery which is pure propaganda the southern states abolished slavery during the war when they concluded an agreement with the british monarchy as a result we once again saw the revolt of the puritans against the british throne which is why some historians speak of the «third british civil war» \\nduring the th century this interior confrontation of british civilisation seemed over and done with apart from the reappearance of the puritans in the united kingdom with the «nonconformist christians» of prime minister david lloyd george it was they who divided ireland and agreed to create the « jewish national homeland» in palestine \\nin any case one of richard nixon’s advisors kevin philipps dedicated a voluminous thesis to these civil wars in which he noted that none of the problems had been solved and announced a fourth confrontation    \\nthe adepts of the calvinist churches who for the last  years have voted massively for the republicans now support the democrats \\ni have no doubt that mrs clinton will be the next president of the united states or that if mr trump were to be elected he would be rapidly eliminated but over the last few months we have witnessed a large electoral redistribution within an irreversible demographic evolution the puritanbased churches now account for only a quarter of the population and are swinging towards the democrat camp their model looks like a historical accident it disappeared in south africa and will not be able to survive much longer either in the united states or in israël beyond the presidential election us society will have to evolve rapidly or split once again in a country where the youth massively rejects the influence of the puritan preachers it is no longer possible to displace the question of equality the puritans envisage a society where all men are equal but not equivalent lord cromwell wanted a republic for the english but only after he had massacred the irish papists this is how it is at the moment in the united states – all citizens are equal before the law but in the name of the same texts black people are systematically condemned while attenuating circumstances are found for white people who have committed equivalent crimes and in the majority of states a penal condemnation even for a speeding ticket is enough to cancel the right to vote consequently white and black people are equal but in most states the majority of black people has been legally deprived of its right to vote the paradigm of this thought in terms of foreign policy is the «twostate» solution in palestine – equal but above all not equivalent \\nit is puritan thinking that led the administrations of preacher carter reagan bush sr and jr are direct descendants of the pilgrim fathers clinton and obama to support wahhabism in contradiction to the declared ideals of their countries and today to support daesh \\na long time ago the founding fathers built communities in plymouth and boston which were idealised in the us collective memory and yet the historians are formal – they claimed to be creating the «new israël» and chose the «law of moses» they did not place the cross in their temples but the tables of the law although they are christians they attach more importance to the jewish scriptures than the gospel they oblige their women to veil their faces and reestablished corporai punishment \\nnote',\n",

the attacks white matter acts like information highways between brain cellssome of the victims woke up in the middle of the night and heard  disembodied chirping in the room or a strange low hum or the sound of scraping metal  others described how  they felt a phantom flutter of air pass by as they listened  there are some victims that did not notice anythingbut the victims felt the effects of these noises or nonnoises  hours later these symptoms included nausea loss of hearing or sight headaches vertigo and dizziness symptoms appeared to have gone away once the victims came back to america

their accusations against the cuban government which denies any involvement despite a history of animosity between the two countriesin october experts provided the mysterious noise to the ap it s high

ed krayewski\\n  reason   there were more protests around the country against the election of donald trump last night with police in portland declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions rioters there threw objects at cops attacked newspaper stands and smashed windows earlier police said protesters were trying to stop anarchist groups from destroying property and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the area before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the unlawful assembly police say they made  arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper spray rubber ball distraction devices and rubber baton rounds\\ntrump returned to twitter for the first time since being elected on tuesday night after spending the day in washington tweeting that professional protesters incited by the media are protesting calling it very unfair nbc news described the tweet as putting an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since tuesday although one salty tweet in a  hour period doesnt seem like enough data to come to that conclusion trump had returned to preelection form as nbc news put it also pointing out trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on washington after mitt romneys  loss and suggested if he lost riots could ensue\\nat least two other prominent trump supporters milwaukee sheriff david clarke and former rep joe walsh had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after they did not expect trump to win so the calculus changed things are different now that hes presidentelect\\x97though not for trumps tendency to make loose statements and the medias tendency to botch interpretations of those statements\\ntrumps tweet was characterized as unpresidential im not sure what was expected at this point particularly since such protests have until now worked in trumps favor the trump campaign cancelled a rally in chicago after massive

to help get trump elected in late september when protests and riots erupted in charlotte after a fatal police shooting there i suggested the city was working hard to get north carolina in the trump column\\non wednesday night when there were protests and vigils around the country i suggested this trend to could end up helping trump by earning him political capital and helping drive nevertrump conservatives back into the fold protesters say they are demonstrating because donald trump has created a climate of fear for minorities riots also have that tendency if the mostly white rioters in portland last night provide police in the city to ramp up enforcement that endangers marginalized people the most protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the contract and its not unreasonable to fear tonights riots will increase tensions in altogether different neighborhoods\\nand for all the talk preelection of voter intimidation what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter intimidation hillary clinton won portland overwhelmingly but that still leaves a minority of trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted and it leaves a slew of residents who didnt vote but will probably eventually be blamed for trumps win as well blame anyone but clinton and the democratic party\\nsome antitrump protesters like to compare trump to hitler yet it doesnt seem they understand their own comparison hitler used civil unrest\\x97specifically the reichstag fire\\x97to greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected at the republican convention trump called america a divided crime scene and said only he could solve the countrys problems antitrump protesters are setting the stage for him its hard to imagine what continued violent protests the portland group has organized as a resistance can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he wants whatever that turns out to be\\na writeup of a mostly white riot in portland would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal land appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones those protesters were called terrorists by many leftwing commentators because they were armed the hashtag oregonunderattack went viral no one has suggested oregon or portland have been under attack tonight nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists but as usual one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as much if not more effect\\nif antitrump protesters are concerned about the powers trump will inherit president obama and the congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power the prospect is unlikely already directionless protests make the prospect less likely and also place efforts at reducing government power after trump is in office at a disadvantage although protesters may be more interesting in

       " 'targeting us automaker signals possible china retaliation over trump talk washingtonbeijing reuters  china’s plan to punish a us automaker accused of pricefixing is a sign of how beijing could retaliate if presidentelect donald trump upends decades of relations between the two nations trump’s assertion that the united states need not be bound by the policy that taiwan is part of “one china” would erode a bedrock of uschina ties that has underpinned the vast increase in trade and cooperation between what are now the world’s two largest economies few expect the disagreement will lead to outright military confrontation nor even the kind of economic war that many feared could be launched by trump’s threat during the us presidential campaign to slap tariffs of up to  percent on chinese imports however a rising china has plenty of other ways to push back hard if trump presses on the taiwan question which most analysts see as the most sensitive part of the uschina relationship in what might be a shot across the bow of the trump administration due to take office on jan  the official china daily newspaper quoted a state planning official saying china will soon penalize an unnamed us automaker for monopolistic behavior while the official said no one should read “anything improper” into this shares of general motors co and ford motor co skidded auto industry sources have told reuters this specific investigation was already underway before trump’s recent comments however the manner in which it was announced by saying only that it was a us automaker before a formal announcement of fines has raised questions around whether officials might be seizing on the case to send a shot across the bow of the incoming trump administration jason miller a spokesman for trump said on wednesday trump’s team was aware of the report but it would be premature to comment in washington a democratic congressional aide said china’s threat to fine the automaker was a “good sharp reminder” to trump that “they have cards to play too and that if he is thinking that he can enter into negotiations  be it on taiwan trade north korea whatever  as if the united states is the sole global superpower  then he is going to need to think again” china’s state planner the national development and reform commission did not responded to reuters requests for comment on the china daily story china’s foreign ministry said it did not know any details about the case “china welcomes foreign companies including american ones to invest in and operate in china at the same time they must respect china’s laws and rules this point is very clear” ministry spokesman geng shuang said when asked if this was china sending a message to trump  pressure on other us companies such as boeing co ban and general electric co gen with large interests in china could be one of the most tangible tools of retaliation together with new limits on access to the country’s huge markets us business interests in china are estimated at more than  billion wider economic steps  such as china america’s biggest creditor selling a significant part of its  trillion of us treasuries or weakening its currency  seem unlikely the first because it would slash the value of china’s us bond portfolio and the second because it could accelerate capital flight experts said beijing could speed up a military buildup that had begun to slow along with chinese economic growth carry out naval exercises close to taiwan  which it regards as a renegade province  and withhold diplomatic cooperation on issues such as iran and north korea’s nuclear programs “taiwan policy is what china considers a core interest  and it’s prepared to go to great lengths to defend it” said eric altbach senior vice president at the albright stonebridge group consultancy in washington and a former deputy assistant us trade representative for china affairs the consensus within the obama administration is that trump who irked china by taking a phone call from taiwan’s president was not fully aware of the potential backlash from beijing over his questioning of the “one china” policy a us official said speaking on condition of anonymity the hope is that by the time trump takes over from president barack obama he will recognize that china has advanced so far economically diplomatically and militarily that it is unwise to pick fights with beijing over such a bedrock principle he added a former senior us official took a more pessimistic view “trump has basically guaranteed that the first year in the china relationship will\\xa0be a combative competitive one and the question is how bad it will get” he said “the chinese now are basically putting together their list on how to retaliate” there are at least three ways in which the matter could play out us china experts said trump could backtrack over time much as former us president george w bush did a second track would be if trump goes on questioning the “one china” policy without taking concrete action the third  considered unlikely by us officials past and present would be a drift toward military confrontation asked if trump’s “one china” stance could lead to this a source with ties to the chinese leadership told reuters “we will see what trump says and does after he becomes president” a second source with leadership ties said they expected tensions with the united states over taiwan but the source said chinese president xi jinping who has sounded a more nationalistic line than his recent predecessors could also use the issue to further cement his grip on power “if taiwan is emboldened by the us support and does something drastic it could be an opportunity for us there will be just cause to dispatch troops” the second source said while the possibility of taiwan declaring independence and hence triggering a chinese invasion seems low the mere softening in the us commitment to the policy would likely play out in china’s defense posture “it will alter chinese defense priorities i think that’s inevitable now” said dennis wilder a former cia china analyst he said xi may increase chinese military spending for  and place new emphasis over time on gaining the amphibious capabilities necessary to actually invade taiwan “xi jinping has to respond to this internally domestically and while he doesn’t want an open fight with trump he will have to show  resolve” he said citing higher military spending more defense exercises and tougher rhetoric on taiwan “we can anticipate that unless this issue is taken off the table”

       " 'us attack on syria cements kremlin’s embrace of assad  the new york times moscow  —   if russia once maintained at least a semblance of distance from president bashar   of syria it rushed to his defense after the american missile strike ordered by president trump on thursday the attack cemented moscow more closely than ever to the notorious syrian autocrat even as the united states condemned mr assad for gassing his own citizens and held russia partly responsible given its  promise to rid syria of chemical weapons the kremlin kept denying that syria had any such capability by championing mr assad and condemning american “aggression” president vladimir v putin of russia seemed to be burying the idea that he could somehow cooperate with the trump administration to end the conflict on his terms the solidarity with damascus is likely to cause problems for russia in the long run analysts said although mr putin probably cannot be persuaded to loosen his embrace any time soon the russian government often takes its time to react to major world events but the kremlin issued a prompt statement early friday castigating the united states for the missile strike on al shayrat airfield in retaliation for syria’s chemical weapons attack the russian ministry of defense vowed to strengthen syria’s air defense systems sent a frigate on a port call and froze an agreement with the united states to coordinate activity in syrian air space “putin made a choice  —   to underline that assad is his ally” said aleksandr morozov an independent political analyst “this will lead to russia’s further isolation but putin will stand his ground ” mr morozov and other analysts consider the policy problematic for various reasons first mr trump and his secretary of state rex w tillerson have painted russia as at least partially responsible for the carnage among civilians that was fomented by the assad government “moscow’s main problem is not that the u s made a strike but that trump and tillerson have toughened their rhetoric on syria and assad” said vladimir frolov a foreign affairs analyst and columnist for republic ru he added “they have said that russia is responsible for assad’s actions and that it didn’t fulfill its responsibilities in terms of chemical weapons disarmament ” the chemical attack in the syrian town of khan sheikhoun on tuesday killed more than  people and afflicted hundreds more turkey said on thursday that sarin a banned nerve agent had been used the united states responded by firing almost  cruise missiles at the air base which housed the warplanes used in the chemical attack the local governor said five military men and two civilians died second in continuing deadly attacks on civilians mr assad seems to want to pursue a military victory at any cost putting a lie to russia’s statements that a negotiated settlement is the sole solution that risks dragging out a war that mr putin has depicted at home as quick cheap and easy at a time when many russians have been struggling economically trying to keep the length and cost of the war down is a crucial reason that the russians will avoid escalating any conflict with the united states analysts said “russia wants to end the conflict and to diminish its military and economic presence” said andrei frolov a defense analyst and the managing editor of the moscow defense brief with the next russian presidential campaign scheduled to start by the end of the year he said “there is no need to continue a war outside the country with a weak explanation for the russian people why russia is staying there ” a poll by the independent levada center in march found that almost  percent of russians already believed that the country’s military involvement in syria made no sense third the assad alliance could undermine one of mr putin’s main goals for entering the war to try to make russia a player on the world stage again as the indispensable broker in the middle east protecting mr assad could further repulse countries that moscow has been courting like turkey and israel analysts said  —   not to mention much of the world in the months immediately after russia deployed its military in syria maria zakharova the spokeswoman for the foreign ministry used to say things like “we don’t support assad what is important for us is to preserve syrian statehood ” after the attack the ministry cranked out a statement lauding syria for its “fierce battle” against “international terrorism ” aleksei v makarkin the deputy head of the center for political technologies a think tank based in moscow said “the longer russia supports assad the more dependent it is on him ” “at the beginning there was some talk about replacing him even if gradually” he said but that talk has evaporated the ostensible reason that mr putin deployed his military in syria in september  was to fight terrorism but that is often dismissed as the   logic other goals especially shoring up mr assad proved more important mr putin wanted to resurrect moscow’s old soviet reputation as a global military power syria proved a showcase for new russian weapons and russia has established two rare overseas bases there “russia will continue to support assad because he is the only guarantor of russia’s military presence in syria and hence of russia’s military presence in the middle east over all” mr makarkin said in addition mr putin was appalled by the way western leaders had abandoned former allies like president hosni mubarak of egypt and col muammar qadhafi of libya mr putin was determined to prove that russia would stick by its friends and oppose “regime change” rooted in outside intervention russia faults the united states for destabilizing countries like iraq and libya  —   which some think has provided an opening for islamic extremists  —   a scenario mr putin was determined to avoid in syria finally of course syria presented russia with an opportunity to break out of the isolation that resulted from sanctions imposed by the west for its  annexation of crimea and destabilization of ukraine the kremlin thought that forging an alliance with the west on syria would render illogical the idea of maintaining the economic sanctions mr trump during his campaign seemed to champion the idea as well questioning the need for sanctions suggesting that crimea probably did belong to russia and repeatedly praising mr putin as a strong leader he endorsed the idea that the two countries together fight the islamic state also known as isil or isis while that raised suspicions in the united states of collusion it was welcomed in russia as a new dawn in relations the illusions began fading as mr trump or his allies reversed many of those positions one by one and the attack on syria pretty much buried them on friday the rubric on rossiya  the state satellite news channel for some of the coverage of the attack was “kaptain amerika” imposed over a zombielike figure with dead eyes “the rest of the   fog has melted away” dmitri medvedev russia’s prime minister wrote on his facebook page “instead of the   narrative about a joint fight against our main enemy isil the trump administration has demonstrated that it will be fiercely fighting the legitimate government of syria ” that mr medvedev responded publicly but not mr putin seemed to indicate moderate anger the first consequence on the ground analysts said is that syria and the russian military will feel less restricted than ever in attacking forces they think are aligned with the west and that they have accused of being terrorists some syrian rebel groups subsidized by the united states and its regional allies have formed battlefield alliances with fighters from al nusra the affiliate of al qaeda in syria “now russia in syria can oppress and destroy opposition forces without regard to the united states and its position” mr frolov the defense analyst said',\n",
       " 'special ed school vouchers may come with hidden costs  the new york times for many parents with disabled children in public school systems the lure of the private school voucher is strong vouchers for special needs students have been endorsed by the trump administration and they are often heavily promoted by state education departments and by private schools which rely on them for tuition dollars so for families that feel as if they are sinking amid academic struggles and behavioral meltdowns they may seem like a life raft and often they are but there’s a catch by accepting the vouchers families may be unknowingly giving up their rights to the very help they were hoping to gain the government is still footing the bill but when students use vouchers to get into private school they lose most of the protections of the federal individuals with disabilities education act many parents among them tamiko walker learn this the hard way only after her son who has a speech and language disability got a scholarship from the john m mckay voucher program in florida did she learn that he had forfeited most of his rights “once you take those mckay funds and you go to a private school you’re no longer covered under idea  —   and i don’t understand why” ms walker said in the meantime public schools and states are able to transfer out children who put a big drain on their budgets while some private schools end up with students they are not equipped to handle sometimes asking them to leave and none of this is against the rules “the private schools are not breaking the law” said julie weatherly a   lawyer who consults for school districts in florida and other states “the law provides no accountability measures ” mckay is the largest of  such disability scholarship programs across the country it serves over   children who have special needs at the senate confirmation hearing for betsy devos president trump’s education secretary she cited research from the conservative manhattan institute saying that “ percent of the parents utilizing that voucher are very very pleased with it ” legal experts say parents who use the vouchers are largely unaware that by participating in programs like mckay they are waiving most of their children’s rights under idea the landmark  federal civil rights law depending on the voucher program the rights being waived can include the right to a free education the right to the same level of   services that a child would be eligible for in a public school the right to a   or   teacher and the right to a hearing to dispute disciplinary action against a child it’s not just florida private school choice programs in arizona colorado georgia oklahoma mississippi tennessee and wisconsin also require parents to waive all or most idea rights in several other states the law is silent on the disability rights of voucher students the walkers obtained a mckay voucher midway through their son’s   year when the port st lucie school district told them it planned to remove the boy from general education classes and place him in a “cluster” classroom for students with emotional difficulties ms walker and another parent quoted in this article asked that their children’s names not be published to protect their privacy “he has more potential than that” ms walker said the family which is black has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the district of racial discrimination and other wrongdoing for disciplining their son harshly and refusing to place him in a   classroom the mckay program has not provided a simple alternative for the walkers they used an   voucher to enroll their son in the achievers institute of science art and technology but they were caught unaware they said when the private school charged them an additional   in fees achievers institute has since gone out of business the boy now uses his mckay voucher to attend the virtual schools of excellence he visits a local “learning center” two to three days a week and the port st lucie school district sends contractors there to provide him with speech and occupational therapy he completes the rest of his instruction online at home “we’re happy to the point where he’s safe” ms walker said but she regrets that her son no longer receives the same intensive instruction in social cues that he benefited from in public school before he became a voucher student federal law requires public school districts to assess the needs of   students enrolled in private schools but districts are not obligated to provide those children with the same services they would receive in a public setting  —   even if a child’s private school tuition is taxpayer funded through a voucher private schools that participate in mckay are not required to demonstrate that they use any type of specialized curriculum to meet disabled children’s needs still many private schools say they go beyond the letter of the law in an effort to serve mckay students trina angelone chief executive of the virtual schools of excellence said the school employed     teachers in both its online program and its   learning center even though this is not required by law a disabled child “going to a typical public school classroom is going to be with maybe  or  students using textbooks following along at the pace of the class” she said “in the virtual space” she said “the child is really getting    attention moving at their own pace ” but ultimately there is no guarantee that students will receive the same level of disability services in private schools that they were entitled to in public school a limitation that parents may not fully understand the state affidavit that parents sign in order to receive a mckay scholarship for example says nothing about forfeiting idea rights and services it also does not explain that parents are responsible for any additional fees a private school may charge on top of a voucher which can range from   to   the florida department of education website provides other materials with more detail on the legal implications of participating in mckay but the documents are difficult to find and decipher   documents are often similarly opaque in a statement provided to the new york times the port st lucie school district said “every effort is made to fully inform parents of the difference between public school services and private school services when a child utilizes a mckay scholarship ” the florida department of education declined requests for a phone interview in an email a department spokeswoman said there had been “very few complaints on this issue ” robyn rennick a board member of the coalition of mckay scholarship schools said that private schools should be transparent with families about the services they provide but that the onus was on parents to ask detailed questions “this is a buyer’s market” she said “you go and say ‘i love your big building but what is the expertise of your teachers ’” many mckay recipients it appears do eventually end up back in the public school system the average length of time in the program is   years according to data provided to the times by the florida department of education and  percent of mckay recipients are in elementary or middle school families who leave the program sometimes do so after moving residences other times they conclude that their child’s needs would be better met in a public school carla donaldson of west palm beach used a mckay voucher to send her son zachary who has autism spectrum disorder to a private school that specializes in serving   students “i needed a break from the fight” for adequate services in a public setting she said zachary blossomed there socially his mother said “unfortunately he did pay the price academically” she said when zachary returned to public school in eighth grade he had to work to catch up “there is no perfect school” ms donaldson said some families find they do not have a choice about whether to continue at a private school last year lisa siegel was surprised to learn that she had few legal options after her seventh grader who received a mckay scholarship was suspended and then asked not to return to a religious school in davie fla near fort lauderdale after a series of behavioral incidents ms siegel’s son is on the autism spectrum in public schools idea guarantees parents the right to a hearing in which they can seek to overturn a disciplinary action if the child’s misbehavior was a manifestation of a disability that is not the case in a private school “you don’t have much recourse” said ms siegel whose son is now at a public school magnet program for marine sciences “i never in a million years thought that in this private educational setting that my child would not be protected by state and federal law ”',\n",
       " 'crucial rule is delayed a year for obama’s health law washington — in a significant setback for president obama’s signature domestic initiative the administration on tuesday abruptly announced a oneyear delay until  in his health care law’s mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties the decision postpones the effective date beyond next year’s midterm elections\\n\\nemployer groups welcomed the news of the concession which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the white house and treasury web sites while the president was flying home from africa republicans’ gleeful reactions made clear that they would not cease to make repeal of obamacare a campaign issue for the third straight election cycle\\n\\nwhile the postponement technically does not affect other central provisions of the law — in particular those establishing health insurance marketplaces in the states known as exchanges where uninsured americans can shop for policies — it threatens to throw into disarray the administration’s effort to put those provisions into effect by jan \\n\\n“i am utterly astounded” said sara rosenbaum a professor of health law and policy at george washington university and an advocate of the law “it boggles the mind this step could significantly reduce the number of uninsured people who will gain coverage in ”\\n\\nat the white house tara mcguinness a senior adviser on the law disputed that\\n\\n“nothing in the new guidance regarding employer reporting and responsibility will limit individuals’ eligibility for premium tax credits to buy insurance through the marketplaces that open on oct ” she said\\n\\nunder the law most americans will be required to have insurance in january  or they will be subject to tax penalties the announcement on tuesday did not say anything about delaying that requirement or those penalties\\n\\nadministration officials sought to put the action in a positive light in the online announcements and they emphasized that the existing insurance coverage of most americans would not be affected\\n\\n“we have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively” mark j mazur an assistant treasury secretary wrote on the department’s web site “we recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so”\\n\\nthe  affordable care act required employers with more than  fulltime workers to offer them affordable health insurance starting next year or face fines some companies with payrolls just above that threshold said they would cut jobs or switch some fulltime workers to parttime employment so that they could avoid providing coverage\\n\\nunder the provision to set up statebased marketplaces subsidies are supposed to be available to many lower and middleincome people who do not have access to coverage from employers or other sources it may be difficult however for officials running the exchanges to know who is entitled to subsidies if employers do not report information on the coverage they provide to workers\\n\\nenrollment in the exchanges is to begin oct  with insurance coverage taking effect on jan  “we are on target to open the health insurance marketplace on oct  where small businesses and ordinary americans will be able to go to one place to learn about their coverage options and make sidebyside comparisons of each plan’s price and benefits before they make their decision” valerie jarrett mr obama’s senior adviser and liaison to the business community wrote on the white house web site\\n\\nbut even some supporters of the law dispute that the establishment of the health insurance exchanges is on schedule especially since progress varies by state and some republicanled states are resisting the health care law and withholding resources for putting it into effect\\n\\nmuch of the administration’s public effort especially at the department of health and human services has been directed toward spreading the word to uninsured americans especially younger and healthy individuals whose participation is needed to help keep down premiums for everyone else about  percent of americans are insured so most individuals will be unaffected at least initially\\n\\nbehind the scenes however the administration has been fielding questions and criticisms from businesses about the reporting requirements — especially the treasury department which has responsibility given its oversight of the tax reporting system\\n\\nemployer groups were quick to applaud the delay at the us chamber of commerce which has strongly opposed the law randy johnson senior vice president for labor immigration and employee benefits said in a statement “the administration has finally recognized the obvious — employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate”\\n\\ne neil trautwein a vice president of the national retail federation said the delay “will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment”\\n\\nmr mazur the treasury official said the delay “will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law”\\n\\n“second” he added “it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees”\\n\\nwithin the next week mr mazur said treasury will issue official guidance to insurers selfinsuring employers and other parties that provide health coverage formal rules will be proposed this summer he added but the administration will encourage employers to comply with the law’s reporting provisions in  as originally mandated\\n\\ndemocrats were all but silent on the news but a spokesman for senator harry reid of nevada the majority leader released a statement late tuesday “both the administration and senate democrats have shown — and continue to show — a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the affordable care act is as beneficial as possible to all involved” the spokesman adam jentleson said “it is better to do this right than fast”\\n\\nbut republicans immediately reacted with statements claiming vindication for their efforts to repeal the law altogether\\n\\nsenator john barrasso republican of wyoming called the administration action “a cynical political ploy to delay the coming train wreck associated with obamacare until after the  elections”\\n\\nand senator mitch mcconnell the senate republican leader who faces reelection next year in kentucky said in a statement “the fact remains that obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with commonsense reforms that actually lower costs for americans”',\n",

source of the leak the commodity futures trading commission opened an insider trading investigation and referred the matter to the united states attorney’s office in manhattan which then began a criminal investigation two people briefed on the matter said but the investigation stalled in the past couple of years one of the people said as the various government authorities sought to resolve the matter negotiations heated up about six weeks ago the statute of limitations on the case was due to expire in the fall mr lacker decided to announce his resignation after being told by the authorities that they had completed their investigation into his role a lawyer representing him said “dr lacker has cooperated with the department of justice and has been informed that no charges will be brought and that the investigation as to him is complete” said the lawyer richard cullen a partner at mcguirewoods mr lacker has a doctorate in economics from the university of wisconsin the fed’s office of the inspector general said tuesday that its investigation also was now complete it is not clear whether any other investigations are in progress the episode occurred after the fed said in september  that it would begin to accumulate mortgage bonds until job growth improved substantially a new chapter in its campaign to stimulate economic growth in the aftermath of the  financial crisis on oct  a day before the fed released an account of its deliberations regina schleiger a medley analyst sent a note to clients saying the fed was likely to announce in december that it would buy treasuries too the note also said that fed officials were considering a statement that the central bank would not raise interest rates before the unemployment rate fell below a threshold of   percent the information was accurate and valuable on the day ms schleiger published her memo the yield on the benchmark   treasury was   percent after the fed’s official account was published the next day the benchmark yield rose to   percent on the day investors who saw the memo  —   titled “fed december bound”  —   could have profited by anticipating that movement mr lacker said tuesday in his statement  —   issued by mcguirewoods rather than the richmond fed  —   that he had not provided any confidential information about the fed’s deliberations to ms schleiger whom he did not name instead he said that ms schleiger mentioned the information and that he had failed to make clear that he could not comment the next day after seeing ms schleiger’s memo mr lacker said “i realized that my failure to decline comment on the information could have been taken by the analyst in the context of the conversation as an acknowledgment or confirmation of the information ” he added “i deeply regret the role i may have played ” after the leak the c f t c pursued an investigation under its “eddie murphy rule ” this rule was a nod to mr murphy’s  movie “trading places” which humorously exposed the legality of insider trading in commodities in  the   act adopted some restrictions on federal employees intentionally providing nonpublic government information to help other people trade in certain markets yet the investigation stalled as the agency and manhattan federal prosecutors were unable to serve a subpoena on medley because it considers itself to be a news organization the people briefed on the matter said the justice department generally avoids issuing subpoenas to news organizations separate from the insider trading rules the fed had announced a new policy in  restricting contact between policy makers and market intelligence firms like medley which traded on the perception that analysts had access to inside information officials were instructed to avoid conversations that might contribute to such impressions mr lacker said tuesday that in speaking with ms schleiger he may have violated this policy too regardless of the contents of the conversation he acknowledged speaking with her multiple times mr lacker  was the   member of the fed’s   committee he became president of the richmond fed in august  he had previously announced that he planned to resign in october the richmond fed said it would continue to search for a new president and that its first vice president mark l mullinix would lead the bank in the interim mr lacker was not a voting member of the fed’s policy committee this year the fed has sought to limit leaks in recent years both by sharing more information with the public and by tightening its communications policies in a statement the fed said “we appreciate the diligent efforts made to bring this matter to its conclusion ”',\n",
       " 'where did the government jobs go  the new york times on a muggy afternoon in april angelina iles  folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved pineville la a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low wet state we drove past     houses and   businesses  —   shuttered restaurants a decrepit gas station  —   as iles an   retired lunchroom worker and community activist guided me toward the muddy banks of the red river near there stands the   art deco shell of the huey p long hospital which once served the poorest of the poor in rapides parish  —   and employed more than  workers when employers leave towns like pineville they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments but in the case of huey p long the employer was the government itself its demise began arguably in  when bobby jindal was swept into the louisiana governor’s mansion on a     platform promising to modernize the state and unleash the power of american private industry along the gulf coast at the time louisiana was flush with federal funds for hurricane katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus jindal and the state legislature slashed income taxes and started privatizing and cutting this was a source of great pride for jindal during his failed bid for the presidency last year he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in louisiana “i’ve laid off more of them than trump has fired people” he said “and i’ve cut my state’s budget by more than he’s worth ” he laid off more than just bureaucrats jindal cut appropriations for higher education shifting the cost burden onto students themselves state spending per student was down more than  percent between  and  just one state arizona cut more and he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the state’s uninsured and indigent they were outdated and costly jindal argued and private management would improve access care and the bottom line huey p long was one of those hospitals iles along with dozens of other workers and activists helped organize a protest against the cuts she told me they held a vigil on the hospital’s front lawn iles even helped produce an   documentary called “bad medicine” that was broadcast on local television but it was all for naught “the good governor did not want to listen to us” iles said checking her constantly buzzing phone in the car the hospital closed its doors in  and its patients were redirected to other local medical centers and clinics all of the hospital’s workers lost their jobs driving around pineville iles and i dropped in on a friend of hers from church theresa jardoin  who worked in the hospital for  years most recently as an ekg supervisor out of work she spends most of her days at home taking care of her family earlier iles had introduced me to another friend linette richard whose story was similar she had been working as an ultrasound technician when the hospital closed she lost much of what she had been expecting for her retirement because she had not been there long enough “nobody’s jumping to hire a    especially in my field” richard said “you can get a   job like mcdonald’s or burger king but higher up we don’t have positions available that’s the way it is ” that’s the way it is across much of louisiana the state has added   new jobs since the great recession officially ended in  but at the same time jobs have been shrinking at every level of government with local offices losing   workers the state government   and the federal government   louisiana is an exaggerated case but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole since the recession hit private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost   the country has recovered from the recession but public employment has not the public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there these are jobs that have predictable hours stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs particularly for those without college or graduate degrees they’re also more likely to be unionized less than  percent of   workers are represented by a union while more than a third of those in the public sector are in other words they look like the   jobs our middle class was built on during the postwar years the public sector’s slow decimation is one of the unheralded reasons that the middle class has shrunk as the ranks of the poor and the rich have swollen in the   years this is certainly true in louisiana where five of the  biggest employers are public institutions or health centers that in no small part rely on public funds in rapides parish which includes pineville the biggest employer is the school district across the country when   workers lose their jobs the burden disproportionately falls on black workers and particularly women  —   people like theresa jardoin and linette richard “we felt middle class” richard told me “now we feel kind of lower ” in the middle of the last century a series of legal and legislative decisions  —   fueled by and fueling the civil rights movement  —   increased the number of black workers in government employment f d r ended official discrimination in the federal government and in companies engaged in the war effort truman desegregated the armed forces kennedy established the committee on equal employment opportunity and johnson signed an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors as a result black workers gained more than a quarter of new federal jobs created between  and  and the share of government jobs held by women climbed  percent between  and  and nearly another  percent by the early s through the middle of the century the wage gap between white and black workers narrowed as social forces and political pressure compelled private businesses to open up better jobs to black workers “  work has been a backbone of the black middle class for many reasons” says mary pattillo a sociologist at northwestern who studies race and class affirmative action helped bring marginalized groups into the public work force there they benefited from more public scrutiny of employment practices “the inability to fire people in a   fashion has likely protected   who are perhaps likely to be fired in a   fashion” she says as of  black workers were  percent more likely than workers of other races to be employed in the public sector for any number of reasons the great recession unraveled much of the progress made by the black middle class leading up to the mortgage crisis black families tended to have a higher proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes and regardless of their income black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into   subprime loans all of this meant that when housing prices turned down the   wealth gap yawned as of  white households were on average  times wealthier than black households the biggest gap since  according to pew research center data declining tax revenue led to tightened state budgets which led to tens of thousands of layoffs for   employees and during the recovery public workers became easy political targets precisely because of their labor protections   rights pension funds and mandatory raises look like unnecessary drains on state coffers to a work force increasingly unfamiliar with such benefits and when the layoffs came black americans experienced a disproportionate share of the ill effects a graduate student of sociology at the university of washington jennifer laird wrote a widely cited dissertation examining the effects of   layoffs on different races she found that the   unemployment rate climbed more for black men than for white men  —   and much more for black women than for white women with the gap between the two groups soaring from less than a percentage point in  to   percentage points in  “it may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding” she wrote “when the number of layoff decisions increases managers have more opportunities to discriminate ” worse once unemployed black women were “the least likely to find   employment and the most likely to make a full exit from the labor force ” as a result of all these economic punishments a recession that set america back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation if not longer and because the public sector provides so many essential services cuts to it have a cascading effect hospitals close and people have to drive farther away for medical care teachers’ aides lose their positions and local kids no longer have the same degree of   attention angelina iles the retiree i met in pineville cited the loss of dental   and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces wisconsin for instance has thinned its ranks of government workers by some   since its republican governor scott walker led a push to abrogate public workers’ organizing rights  —   a political choice with profound economic and racial ramifications “they try to say that collective bargaining is a drain on the economy when it provides the ability and opportunity for folks to have a seat at the table” lee saunders the president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees told me and the economic evidence does show that a higher concentration of unionized workers increases intergenerational mobility and raises wages for all workers public and private with time government jobs should come back that pathway to the middle class should grow again “government jobs are always slower to come back after a recession” says roderick harrison a former howard university demographer it takes time for private businesses to rehire workers it takes time for tax revenue to rise to a level at which cities and states feel comfortable adding public workers back onto their payrolls “that means that the portion of the black middle class that was dependent on government jobs  —   police schools emergency workers and so on  —   is going to take longer to recoup and regain whatever positions they had” he says for pineville that recovery might come too late for many of its workers especially those who were looking toward retirement because linette richard can’t find suitable work she and her husband get by on what he makes as a car salesman she has given up trying to find work again around pineville so has theresa jardoin who has resigned herself to a tougher retirement than she thought she would enjoy “all of a sudden there’s nothing” she said sitting in an easy chair in her living room just blocks from huey p long playing with her granddaughter’s hair “you can’t enjoy retirement in this situation ” “you didn’t even get a pocket watch did you” iles asked “no” jardoin said with a resigned laugh “just aches and pains ”',\n",

       " 'missing from trumps grand navy plan skilled workers to build the fleet  washington reuters  us president donald trump says he wants to build dozens of new warships in one of the biggest peacetime expansions of the us navy but interviews with shipbuilders unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan  the initiative could cost nearly  billion in government funding take  years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers  many of whom don’t exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained according to the interviews and the documents reviewed  trump has vowed a huge buildup of the us military to project american power in the face of an emboldened china and russia that includes expanding the navy to  warships from  today he has provided no specifics including how soon he wants the larger fleet for graphics on projected strength of us navy shipyard employment see tmsnrtrsnvor  the navy has given defense secretary jim mattis a report that explores\\xa0how the country’s industrial base could support higher ship production admiral bill moran the vice chief of naval operations with oversight of the navy’s shipbuilding outlook told reuters  he declined to give further details but those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues  there are not enough skilled workers in the market from electricians to welders and after years of historically low production shipyards and their suppliers including nuclear fuel producers will struggle to ramp up for years  to be sure the first and biggest hurdle for trump to overcome is to persuade a costconscious congress to fund the military buildup  the white house declined to comment a navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require “sufficient time” to allow companies to ramp up capacity  the two largest us shipbuilders general dynamics corp gdn and huntington ingalls industries inc hiin told reuters they are planning to hire a total of  workers in  just to meet current orders such as the columbia class ballistic missile submarine  general dynamics hopes to hire  workers at electric boat this year currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than  workers to nearly  by the early s company documents reviewed by reuters show  huntington ingalls the largest us military shipbuilder plans to hire  at its newport news shipyard in norfolk virginia and another  at the ingalls shipyard in mississippi this year to fulfill current orders spokeswoman beci brenton said  companies say they are eager to work with trump to build his bigger navy but expanding hiring for now is difficult to do until they receive new orders officials say  “it’s hard to look beyond” current orders brenton said  smaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious  “you can’t hire people to do nothing” said jill mackie spokeswoman for portland oregonbased vigor industrial llc which makes combat craft for the navy’s special warfare units “until funding is there  you can’t bring on more workers”  because companies won’t hire excess workers in advance they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes said bryan clark who led strategic planning for the navy as special assistant to the chief of naval operations until   union and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as  per year including overtime and benefits said danny hendrix the business manager at pipeliners local  a union representing  metal workers in  states  much of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many can’t get said jimmy hart president of the metal trades department at the aflcio union which represents  boilermakers machinists and pipefitters among others  to help grow a larger labor force from the ground up general dynamics’ electric boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in connecticut and rhode island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers  “it has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding” said maura dunn vice president of human resources at electric boat  it can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclearpowered submarine said will lennon vice president of the shipyard’s columbia class submarine program  the navy envisioned by trump could create more than  jobs the shipbuilders council of america a trade group representing us shipbuilders repairers and suppliers told reuters  the us shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly  in  labor department statistics show the industry had as many as  workers at the height of the cold war in the early s as the united states built up a fleet of nearly  warships by the end of that decade  apart from the labor shortage there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the navy especially its submarine fleet  expanding the navy to  ships is not as simple as just adding  ships many ships in the current vessel fleet need to be replaced which means the navy would have to buy  ships between now and  to reach trump’s goal the congressional budget office said in a report in february  the shipyards that make nuclear submarines  general dynamics’ electric boat in groton connecticut and huntington’s newport news  produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early s but for more than a decade now the yards have not built more than two per year  the nuclearpowered virginia class and columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build the first columbia submarine which is set to begin construction in  will take seven years to build and two to three additional years to test  retooling the longdormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain said clark the former strategist for the navy and now a senior fellow at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments  makers of submarine components such as reactor cores big castings and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production said a congressional official with knowledge of the navy’s longterm planning  “we have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year you can’t then just throw one or two more on top of that and say ‘oh here dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two’ you just can’t” the official said  in his first budget proposal to congress on thursday trump proposed boosting defense spending by  billion for the fiscal  year – a  percent increase from last year he is also seeking  billion for the defense department in a supplemental budget for fiscal  of which at least  million is earmarked for military shipbuilding  a ship navy would cost  billion over the year period or  billion per year   percent more than the average funding the navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades the congressional budget office said  senator john mccain chairman of the senate armed services committee who will have a major say in approving the defense budget said in a statement to

strategic city of deir alzour in spite of the unlikely coincidence washington claimed this was all just  a mistake in addition us coalition and gulfbacked  rebel  terrorists had already broke the russiaus ceasefire multiple times and are also on record boasting earlier in the week how terroristheld east aleppo militants would refuse any un aid convoy that crossed their sightsdid the us and its  rebel  forces on the ground orchestrate another false flag event designed to avoid condemnation of saturday s massacre our western colleages are putting their best efforts to hype up the situation and  blur  the tragedy in deir ezzor and to distract the international community from alnusra s advance on aleppo and thus cover the us incompetence in distinguishing between the  moderate  opposition and terrorists in syria    russian spokepersonnow new evidence suggests that the us coalition may be misleading the world about their true intentions  rtthe russian defense ministry says that a us coalition drone was in the vicinity of a humanitarian convoy when it was attacked outside aleppo according to the russian military the unmanned aircraft was a predator drone on the evening of september  in that specific region a drone belonging to the international condition which had taken off from the incirlik air base in turkey was flying at a height of  meters and traveling at around  kilometers per hour  said russian defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov the object was in the area around the town of urm alkubra where the convoy was a few minutes before it caught fire  konashenkov added  it left after about  minutes the defense ministry spokesman said he wanted to point out that as was the case with the tragedy on september  which saw usled coalition airstrike kill and injure  people the russians would not be making any unfounded allegations only the owners know what exactly the drone was doing at this particular area at that exact time  he addedmoscow says it has provided all the data it possesses regarding the attack on the convoy which was carrying aid to rebelheld areas in aleppo russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said at a un security council meeting on wednesday there was another unacceptable provocation on september    the shelling of a humanitarian convoy near aleppo  he said  i am confident that such coincidences require serious analysis and an investigation on september  a humanitarian convoy consisting of  trucks was attacked while heading to aleppo according to the red cross  civilians and one aid worker died as a result initial reports claimed the convoy had been targeted by an airstrike later the un said all it could confirm was that the convoy was attackedon tuesday the russian defense ministry reiterated that neither it nor the syrian military had launched airstrikes on the convoy russian and syrian warplanes did not carry out any airstrikes on a un humanitarian aid convoy in the southwest of aleppo  konashenkov said in a statement he added that the military had studied video footage of the convoy which appeared to rule out that an airstrike took place we have closely studied the video footage from where the incident took place and we did not find any signs of any ammunition having hit the convoy there are no craters while the vehicles have their chassis intact and they have not been severely damaged which would have been the case from an airstrike  konashenkov said all of the video footage demonstrates that the convoy caught fire which strangely happened almost at exactly at the same time as militants started a largescale offensive on aleppo in a statement konashenkov said moscow was compelled to disclose the  sensitive details  in response to the accusations made by us deputy national security adviser ben rhodes who has laid the blame for the attack on the aid convoy on russia this type of drone can not only monitor the situation but also guide ground weapons to their targets and inflict surgical airstrikes at objects located on the ground by itself  the russian spokesman explained read more at rtread more syria news at st century wire syria files',\n",

people to pay their taxes if the government is not viewed as legitimate”  catherine austin fitts \\nthe world economy is designed to fail through the mechanism of a banking system that requires all users of money to pay usury every time a transaction takes place in this way the financial systems of the world can be manipulated into a managed collapse thereby causing global chaos so that the world’s nations and citizens can be tricked into demanding a global currency managed a global elite \\nproblem reaction solution economic hit man john perkins wrote about this strategy as it was used in the th century to bring developing nations under the control of the international monetary fund and transnational profiteers and at present this scheme is being globalized \\n“if an ehm is completely successful the loans are so large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a few years when this happens then like the mafia we demand our pound of flesh this often includes one or more of the following control over united nations votes the installation of military bases or access to precious resources such as oil or the panama canal of course the debtor still owes us the money—and another country is added to our global empire” john perkins confessions of an economic hit man \\nfor decades now the dollar has been in a slow burn style of collapse and while many journalists primarily outside of the mainstream have been warning the world about how and why this is happening we’re quickly approaching a turning point where the slow burn moves into something more severe while at first glance this seems like a frightening potentiality the truth is that an economic collapse may very well be our best chance at freeing ourselves from the rule of the gods of money  a whistleblower warns us and gives us hope \\nspeaking to greg hunter of usa watchdog news  former wall street banker and former assistant secretary of housing and federal housing commissioner at the united states department of housing and urban development in the first bush administration  catherine austin fitts explains why the slow burn is about to come to an end \\n“the system has the capacity with monetary policy in one sense to keep going forever if the force and military capacity is there to do it but at some point you burn through the fat you burn through the muscle and then you have to change institutions”  catherine austin fitts \\nduring the financial crisis of  the government was able to prevent an uncontrolled firestorm collapse of the system by colluding with the chiefs of the financial sector giving them bailouts of extraordinary magnitude  then inflating the dollar by the federal reserve’s introduction of quantitative easing  eight years later this tactic has reached its limit however it has given the public significant reason and time to understand why our economy functions the way it does and people are losing faith in our leadership \\n“it’s going to be extremely difficult to get people to continue to pay their taxes when they’re highly confident the money’s not being spent legally and it’s going to the advantage of small parties or things that they don’t understand and so you can’t move further without institutional overhaul” catherine austin fitts \\nthe thing that frightens her most is the fact that groups within the us such as alec  are already calling for changes in the law and even a new constitutional convention to overhaul these institutions the financial sector has already been operating outside of the law and beyond the constitution for some twenty plus years and if we haven’t been using the constitution she notes then why do they wish to change it \\n“if you want to enforce the constitution or fix things that’s what you do the reason you get a constitutional convention is you want to tear it up because you’re worried now that people realize the extent of the corruption that they’re going to try and enforce” catherine austin fitts \\nher warning is that as people continue to wake up to the corruption of our government and financial rulers the entrenched elites who are fully invested in destroying the middle class will fight tooth and nail to prevent us from holding them accountable by means of bringing more draconian laws into place to protect themselves \\nin this light the economic war that is brewing isn’t completely technical it is social as well quickly becoming class warfare the world’s financial elite are in grave danger of being held to the fire for their crimes and surely they know

from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what us intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by russia to interfere with the nov  election us intelligence officials acquired the documents which were prepared by the moscowbased russian institute for strategic studies enrissru after the election the institute is run by retired senior russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by putin’s office  the first russian institute document was a strategy paper written last june that circulated at the highest levels of the russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals it recommended the kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and russian statebacked global news outlets to encourage us voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward russia than the administration of thenpresident barack obama the seven officials said  a second\\xa0institute document drafted in october and distributed in the same way warned that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was likely to win the election for that reason it argued it was better for russia to end its protrump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the us electoral system’s legitimacy and damage clinton’s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency the seven officials said the current and former us officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the russian documents’ classified status they declined to discuss how the united states obtained them us intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them putin has denied interfering in the us election putin’s spokesman and the russian institute did not respond to requests for comment  the documents were central to the obama administration’s conclusion that russia mounted a “fake news” campaign and launched cyber attacks against democratic party groups and clinton’s campaign the current and former

activities had no impact on the outcome of the race ongoing congressional and fbi investigations into russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that trump associates colluded with the russian effort to change the outcome of the election four of the officials said the approach outlined in the june strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the putin administration launched in

from traditional media outlets”  the report said the agencies did not assess whether moscow’s effort had swung the outcome of the race in trump’s favor because american intelligence agencies do not “analyze us political processes or us public opinion” bitlykmiksa neither of the russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked democratic party emails to interfere with the us election

       " 'renting a car know the rules of the road  the new york times having booked their flights and secured their hotels travelers often consider rental cars among the last of their   tasks making the unprepared more vulnerable to the    of industry fees “our number one advice for renters is to do their homework” said david solomito vice president of marketing for north america at kayak “for most people rental cars are the least considered part of trip ” as technology has changed travel  —   consider toll roads which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  —   so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars “it’s not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees it’s just that there’s more of them” said rick garlick who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at j d power which conducts consumer surveys including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction for the third year running enterprise has ranked highest “ancillary fees as with airlines are how the companies retain profitability” he said there are a number of ways to save money on rental cars including renting from a location that’s not at an airport which kayak says will save you an average of  percent but there are several charges that tend to nip renters’ wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought assuming you haven’t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed which usually means full but the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area “at hertz we do not have a mileage restriction we simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with” wrote lauren luster communications manager with hertz in an email this lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies i recently returned a car to avis in miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal only to find a “fuel service” charge of   on my bill an avis employee redacted it when i objected a spokeswoman for avis said the company has about   “connected” cars which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility “we carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim” wrote alice pereira an avis spokeswoman in an email industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility “cars aren’t getting smarter we need to be” said lauren fix an author and automotive writer also known as the car coach “if you have a receipt to prove you refilled they will usually refund the fee any pushback i ask for a manager ” drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads but once they are triggered by a tollgate the devices initiate a daily rental fee often regardless of whether it is used each day these fees are in addition to the actual tolls so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from miami to key west you will pay somewhere between   a day for the device at payless car rental to   a day with hertz these fees are usually capped avis charges a maximum of   per rental month hertz charges   maximum per rental agreement and payless charges   maximum for each rental period enterprise national and alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for   per day it is used with a maximum charge of   for the rental term car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash when the option exists avoid toll roads or bring their own

and west to illinois an   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car so forget using it if you rent a   some toll roads in california will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract that doesn’t take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs “it messes with their inventory and planning” said mr solomito of kayak “returning a car early is considered breaking the contract ” how early is early depends on the company but generally anything less than  hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount if earlier dollar rent a car for example will only charge for the days used and add a  charge according to the company website “to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use ” late returns generally trigger fees and like airline rebooking any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to hertz encourages customers to call its rental extensions department they may be subject to a    fee through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car if they don’t call however they can be subject to a fee of  a day up to a maximum of  in addition to daily rental charges parking or traffic tickets are the driver’s responsibility but if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully it’s in a rental car where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company these penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract avis’s contract

       " 'why paul manafort indictment is bad news for dirty cop robert mueller this summarization by peter flaherty president of the national legal and policy center of why the indictment of paul manafort actually exposes the truth about the dirty dealings of special prosecutor robert mueller is brilliant and is a mustread for anyone who cares to see what s really going on behind the curtaindaily caller   more than anything else the indictments of paul manafort and his partner rick gates demonstrate the fraudulent nature of special counsel robert mueller s investigation the probe has little to do with russian interference in last year s election instead it is calculated to protect mueller and a cabal within the fbi and justice department who covered up crimes by hillary clinton because they believed it was likely that she would be elected presidentand once mueller and then his friend and successor james comey covered for hillary they had to keep covering there was a reason that mueller was so available when he was so swiftly appointed special counsel in may by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein the comey firing threatened to expose all that these same officials had swept under the rug yes rosenstein bit the bullet and drafted the memo that was the legal basis for firing comey but it would be followed by appointing muellerin july comey preemptively exonerated hillary despite her maintenance of a private email server and mishandling of classified material by accusing her of being  extremely careless  he purposely distracted attention from the context of the emails hillary and bill clinton operated an aggressive shakedown operation of domestic and foreign interests many of which are unsavory and criminal concealing the true nature of the operation was at least part of the clintons  motivation for the private serverthe outlines of the uranium one deal were not a secret media outlets like the new york times reported on the us government approval of a partial sale of the canadian mining company to rosatom a russian firm while those who benefitted donated to the clinton foundation and paid bill clinton  for a single speech in moscowthen came more detailed reports about how the fbi cracked the case of a major russian effort to penetrate the north american uranium industry through a host of illegal activities but somehow the whole matter was slowwalked and kept from us government officials who had to approve the uranium one deal mueller and comey ultimately supervised the probemeanwhile the fbi s email investigation was supervised by nowfbi deputy director andrew mccabe who has significant connections to the clintons through his wife jill mccabe hillary headlined a fundraiser for a group supporting jill mccabe s campaign for the virginia state senate as first reported in the wall street journal the national legal and policy center subsequently exposed more clintonista support including from thenclinton foundation operative doug band who wrote a personal check for the plot thickened last week when the bombshell hit that it was hillary s campaign and the democratic national committee that paid for the fusion gps dossier reporters were chagrined to realize that they had been lied to repeatedly for months and months hillary now claims that the first she heard of it was when the dossier memo was printed by buzzfeed in january a likely lie as long as this  what did hillary know and when did hillary know it  question is of no interest to mueller his investigation has no credibility whatsoever but therein lies the dilemma for mueller a real probe of hillary would mean a review of his own actions and those of his colleagues he s corneredmueller s strategy is clear he has to rescue himself comey mccabe rosenstein and others from their complicity in hillary s dealings with the russians mueller is creating a diversion by going after manafort the lowest of lowhanging fruit just about any inquiry into manafort s dealings over the years was sure to yield resultsthe left and the leftist media are apoplectic over the possibility that they finally have trump in their crosshairs the problem is after the media smoke has cleared the truth is revealed about the manafort indictment and the facts point to president trump having nothing to do with it democrats would love nothing more than to see president trump fire special prosecutor robert mueller as it would prove that he was guilty of the trumprussian narrative the democrats and their allies in the media have been pushing since the night he soundly defeated hillary clinton in the election upset of the century watch jay sekulow explain to rabid cnn host wolf blitzer that trump has nothing to do with either the announcement of the  indictments of paul manafort or campaign volunteer george papadopoulos ',\n",

yearold has walked free\\n\\non march  hbo aired the fifth and penultimate episode of “the jinx” which included a previously uncovered piece of evidence on the eve of the finale durst was arrested in new orleans in connection to the murder of his friend susan berman a little more than  years ago sunday night the final episode aired in its closing minutes durst says “what the hell did i do killed them all of course”\\n\\nhe was not speaking to the camera and was seemingly unaware his words were being recorded — but he had left his microphone on while using the bathroom\\n\\n‘the jinx’ director says he gave authorities the ‘killed them all’ audio months ago\\n\\nearlier in the day durst’s attorney chip lewis told the post “he’s maintained his innocence for  years now nothing has changed” it

of timing the arrest as a publicity stunt for the last episode in january jarecki all but promised tv critics and reporters that the “the jinx” would end with a satisfying conclusion — something many thought “serial” lacked because host sarah koenig ended the podcast with no concrete theory the widely publicized arrest and the audio of what could be interpreted as a confession surely fits the bar he set\\n\\ndurst has been a willing participant in the series that may have brought about\\xa0his downfall he spent more than  hours in interviews with filmmaker jarecki who has been researching durst\\xa0for eight years jarecki’s  film “all good things” was a fictionalized version of the durst story in which ryan gosling played a somewhatempathetic\\xa0version of\\xa0a killer\\n\\nin an interview with the los angeles times jarecki said that durst came to him after seeing the film admitting it made him cry three times the two have been working together ever since with durst agreeing to let jarecki ask any question\\n\\nit wasn’t a question that led to the arrest however in\\xa0an episode titled “family values” the filmmakers\\xa0met with\\xa0the stepson of berman durst’s friend who was found dead on christmas eve  police were led to her body by a letter that told them of a “cadaver” at her address\\n\\nthat\\xa0letter was addressed\\xa0“beverley hills police” in block letters beverly is misspelled\\n\\nat the end of episode five berman’s stepson shows the filmmakers a\\xa0letter from durst to berman from the march before she was murdered on the envelope durst wrote berman’s address in block letters he spelled “beverly” as “beverley”\\n\\ndurst had known berman a writer and daughter of a known las vegas mobster since they met at the university of california in the s when durst’s wife kathie went missing in from their house in new york in  berman asserted\\xa0durst’s innocence to the media in the series jarecki seems to be hinting that berman helped\\xa0durst hide kathie’s body\\n\\nhe asks durst about his habit of making collect calls to his family company the durst organization soon after kathie went missing a number of collect calls were made to the company from an area known as the pine barrens in new jersey this heavilywooded land had the reputation of being a dumping ground for the bodies of mafia victims\\n\\n“and what connection is that” asks kevin hynes the assistant district attorney on the case “well susan berman who was very friendly with durst at the time had a lot of connections and a lot of friends in organized crime”\\n\\nthe filmmakers take you to the places durst might have been like the pine barrens and what they can’t show you live footage of they recreate durst appears on screen to rebut theories and allegations wearing a grey cable sweater and khaki pants he nearly always speaks calmly like an eccentric yearold man recounting an old story not\\xa0a\\xa0man from one of the richest families in new york trying to convince you he’s not a triplemurderer\\n\\nuntil the final episode durst\\xa0has maintained in the series that he did not kill his wife and does not know where her body is the camera crew had already packed up from the day’s interviewing but the recorder kept rolling as durst went to the bathroom\\n\\nit appears he was talking to himself making comments that included “there it is you’re caught you’re right of course but you can’t imagine arrest him \\u2009\\u2009 what a disaster \\u2009\\u2009i’m having difficulty with the question” then follows the “i killed them all” line\\n\\nfilmmakers told the new york times they didn’t find the recording for more than two years\\n\\ndurst admitted to killing one of the three persons that “them all” could inlude his\\xa0yearold neighbor morris black in  durst was living in galveston texas\\xa0dressing as a female to avoid media attention about the reopened investigation of his wife’s disappearance\\n\\nhe testified that his neighbor who he was friends with for a time sneaked into his apartment when a scuffle occurred between the two men durst shot his neighbor accidentally in selfdefense he then “panicked” cut up the body with a bow saw and dumped it into\\xa0galveston bay black’s\\xa0head was never found\\n\\nafter four days of deliberation the jury acquitted durst\\n\\njudge susan criss who oversaw the galveston trial told the post sunday she could not be more thrilled that durst was arrested “presiding over that trial was like watching a slow train wreck the prosecution dropped the ball

exceptionally cunning serial killer a man made all the more dangerous by his financial resources\\n\\n“i saw the pictures of the cut up body” she said “that body was cut up like it had been done by a surgeon he knew what sort of tool to use for this bone and that muscle it would have been impossible for someone to do that if it was their first murder attempt that is a cold calculating act”\\n\\nthe durst organization his family’s prominent real estate company also applauded the arrest in a statement to cnbc durst’s brother douglas said “we are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of robert durst we hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done”\\n\\ndurst has been estranged from his family for years when his father cut him out of the line of succession for the family’s real estate empire in  durst is said to have urinated in his uncle’s waste basket\\n\\nhis penchant for theatrics might be what drove durst to allow — and assist — \\xa0jarecki\\xa0in publicly dissecting his life\\n\\n“he has a compulsion to tell his story and frankly i think he enjoys the feeling of being at risk” the filmmaker told the los angeles times in february “he knows that this is a very live ball that he hasn’t been prosecuted for two of the three murders that he’s been accused of”\\n\\n“we simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that andrew jarecki and producer marc smerling did in producing the jinx” hbo said in a statement “years in the making their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in robert durst’s story with the public and law enforcement”\\n\\ncoincidence or not there’s no doubt the timing of durst’s arrest will lead\\xa0to a surge in viewers for “the jinx” the accused himself\\xa0meanwhile will be sitting in a new orleans jail cell or on his way back to california to face the murder charge\\n\\n“we’ll saddle up and head west” durst’s lawyer said “and handle this one just like we did

       " 'they fought and died to protect total strangers from socialism…why young voters are embracing the same evil in america today this is a brilliantly written piece by nick short of politically short on the successful indoctrination our youth he explains what has led the to rabid support bernie sanders an avowed socialist and a true disciple of saul alinsky hillary clinton in his book the snapping of the american mind david kupelian asks the following painful question that millions of americans like myself have pondered for years and will ponder for some time to come as america slowly rips itself apart kupelian writes  how could it be that hundreds of thousands of americans fought and bled   and many died   on foreign shores to contain an evil and metastasizing ideology variously called communism marxism socialism collectivism or statism and yet now just a few years later we would gaze up at the pinnacle of power in our own country and behold leaders in thrall to essentially the same core ideology we fought and died to protect strangers from the answer to this is can be found within the culture itself and more specifically within americas youth who have seemingly embraced the concept of socialism with little to no understanding of what socialism even is yet like frogs slowly boiling to death in the cesspools that have become our college campuses our nations youth collectively embrace the ideology that will destroy them while demanding that they be  protected  from opinions that run contrary to their beliefs for instance after the outspoken conservative and feminist critic milo yiannopoulos gave a speech at rutgers university the college responded in a way that has become typical in the cesspools that are our academia writing in the rutgers campus newspaper the daily targum noa halff notesstudents and faculty gathered in the paul robeson cultural center on busch campus to generate dialogue about yiannopoulos s visit and the protest that occurred during his lecture a variety of different organizations and departments were present to listen answer questions and show supportrepresentatives from the rutgers university police department the office of violence prevention and victim assistance counseling alcohol and other drug assistance program and psychiatric services and the bias prevention and education committee were present members from the black student union the asian american cultural center center for latino arts and culture college student affairs and many more were also in attendancein short this official response to a conservative speaker from what was once one of america s most prestigious universities is a damning indictment of a generation that has been primed for totalitarianism the fact that this isn t an isolated example is bad but what s worse is that these very same college students have become champions of government regulated speech so long as the speech being regulated emanates from the right this is happening while at the same time students are actively discouraged from thinking for themselves it s a testament to how successful the left has been in capturing our nations schools that today analytical thinking once the basis of our education system is virtually goneit s a symptom of progressivism to see that the supposed  college educated  today have become fierce proponents for government regulated speech but progressivism itself is not the underlying root cause the cause itself can be found in the ideology known as liberalism which has been carried to its logical and practical extreme totalitarianismas james burnham explained in his  classic suicide of the west  liberalism has always operated most naturally as a tendency of opposition to the prevailing order to the status quo the ancien r gime the establishment in general or in its several parts  liberalism continues burnham  has always stressed change reform the break with encrusted habit whether in the form of old ideas old customs or old institutions thus liberalism has been and continues to be primarily negative in its impact on society  what is different today though is that liberalism now controls all the powerful institutions of culture from the media to education and everything in between while at the same time it faces literally no opposition the left controls the culture and given that political issues are often decided at the cultural level before they even reach the political realm the opposition is almost always rendered defenseless or in the case of college campuses the opposition isn t even permitted to make its caseit is outright totalitarianism that is taking place today within american society from the silencing of conservatives on college campuses to forcing christian business owners to pay excessive fines and face prison sentences for holding true to their beliefs in traditional marriage the nation has fractured into two separate americas that continue to drift further and further apart with half the nation seemingly convinced that their rights stem from the government while the other from god the former seeks not only to control the latter but to see to it that the latter is utterly destroyed to accomplish this liberalism functions as all totalitarian movements have functioned in the past by subjecting individuals to unbearable stress conflict and crisis until each is broken whether the means to do so are accomplished financially spiritually culturally or psychologically matters little as it always justifies the end the end of course being the destruction of the will of each and every american so that liberalism can remake the individual from the ashes in which it has destroyed themliberalism wants you to snap it wants to challenge your sanity and destroy your belief system so that it can remold you in its image of dependency first and foremost though it must extinguish those institutions in which we hold dear it is why since his first day in office barack obama has relentlessly attacked the cultural moral and religious institutions that those of us on the right hold dear yet even obama himself is not solely the one to blame for he represents the logical extreme of liberalism he is a symptom of the progressive creation and his rise to the pinnacle of power in this nation represented a turning point for the worse as the government has been infused with an ideology of totalitarianism take a look at any government agency functioning today and you d be hard pressed to find just one that isn t completely politicized into attacking the ideological opponents of progressivism in turn you can do the same exact thing with our culture itself and you ll find the same results wherever the progressives are in power from the government to the culture to the academia and the media the hatred of western values dominatespopular discourse today sees the west in general as being  guilty of genocidal crimes against civilization  for western values seen through the lens of liberalism represents the  greatest repository of racism sexism xenophobia antisemitism fascism and narcissism  as the father of the new left herbert marcuse so eloquently put it  american society is oppressive evil and undeserving of loyalty  with this notion in mind liberalism places a new emphasis on liberating all men and women from the  evil repression  and  tyrannical values  that western civilization was built upon to bring this about progressives have designed numerous strategies to discredit and smear the values that had forged and sustained the west for the past  years the left no matter what they call themself today breeds the ideology the totalitarianism as every single proposed and forced through  reforms  serves to reduce human personality to its most primitive levels and to extinguish the highest most complex and  godlike  aspects of human individuality even equality itself while serving as a powerful appeal to the masses with its great promises of  each according to his need  turns out to signify not equality of rights of opportunities and of external conditions but equality of complete uniformity in thought and conditionthe total implementation of the principles espoused by liberalism deprives human life of individuality and simultaneously deprives life of its meaning and attraction america isn t at this point yet but it is coming as reflected in a generation that is at best negligent and at worst complicit in the march towards totalitarianism how do i know for certain that this is where we are headed because what iv e been calling progressive totalitarianism is what was once called socialism and following the basic tendency of socialism liberalism is hostile toward human personality not only as a category but ultimately to its very existence in the words of alexander solzhenitsyn  socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into

       " 'hillary clinton’s push on gun control marks a shift in presidential politics in her standard stump speech hillary rodham clinton talks about fighting income inequality celebrating court rulings on gay marriage and health care and since the emanuel ame church massacre toughening the nation’s gun laws\\n\\nthat last component marks an important evolution in presidential politics for at least the past several decades democrats seeking national office have often been timid on the issue of guns for fear of alienating firearms owners in  after barack obama took heat for his gaffe about people who “cling to guns or religion” he rarely mentioned guns again — neither that year nor in his  reelection campaign\\n\\nbut in a sign that the political environment on guns has shifted in the wake of recent mass shootings — and of clinton’s determination to stake out liberal ground in her primary race against insurgent sen bernie sanders ivt — clinton is not only initiating a debate about gun control but also vowing to fight the national rifle association\\n\\n“i’m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because i believe we can do better” clinton said tuesday in iowa city\\n\\na few days earlier she said in hanover nh “we have to take on the gun lobby \\u2009\\u2009 this is a controversial issue i am well aware of that but i think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it”\\n\\nclinton’s comments could stoke millions of politically active gun owners and wayne lapierre the nra’s executive vice president argued that the move was fraught with peril for her\\n\\n“we’ve been down this road before with the clintons” \\xadla\\xadpierre said through a spokesman “she needs to read her husband’s book”\\n\\nin his memoir “my life” former president bill clinton suggested that his vice president al gore lost the  presidential election in part because of backlash in states such as arkansas and tennessee over the clinton administration’s  ban on assault weapons which has since expired many democratic lawmakers also lost their elections after guncontrol votes\\n\\nthe republican  presidential candidates in keeping with gop orthodoxy have spoken out loudly against gun control many gave speeches at the nra’s spring convention and tout their high ratings from the group\\n\\nmark glaze a longtime guncontrol advocate who until recently oversaw former new york mayor michael r bloomberg’s guncontrol efforts argued that hillary clinton should embrace her husband’s record\\n\\n“the clintons pulled off the almostimpossible by giving us the backgroundcheck system and banning assault weapons” glaze said “that’s something president obama wasn’t able to do their political interest lies in owning rather than obscuring that accomplishment”\\n\\nmany democratic strategists said campaigning on guns is smart politics for hillary clinton both in the primary and should she become the nominee in the general election\\n\\ngun control is one of the few issues on which clinton has a more leftleaning record than sanders who represents a rural progunrights state and has voted in the past for legislation to protect the firearms industry although clinton has not attacked sanders by name by invoking guns she makes an unspoken contrast\\n\\nthe issue also fits neatly into the overall narrative clinton is trying to present she can stake out a bold stance on an issue that plays well with the liberal base while arguing that she would break through the partisan stalemate in washington\\n\\nthere are few issues more in\\xadtrac\\xadtable than guns in  after the massacre of  young children and six educators at an elementary school in \\xadnewtown conn a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for firearm purchases failed to pass the senate despite overwhelming popular support and president obama’s backing\\n\\nclinton began talking about gun control in the days following last month’s church shooting in charleston sc and aides said she plans to keep it in her stump speech although she has no immediate plans to unveil a detailed gun policy\\n\\n“this is an important issue and she believes that we cannot let partisan gridlock prevent us from continuing to seek \\xadcommonsense safety measures” said clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon\\n\\ndespite his mixed voting record sanders did support the  backgroundcheck bill and \\xadassaultweapons ban and on the stump he is trying to sound more forceful he notes that “guns in chicago and los angeles mean a very different thing than guns in vermont and new hampshire” but says — as he did two weeks ago in bow nh — that the next president must “come forward with a commonsense proposal on guns”\\n\\nin the democratic field former maryland governor martin o’mal\\xadley has the strongest record in favor of gun control he supported an assaultweapons ban as mayor of baltimore in the early s and then signed one into law as governor in  along with a suite of gun restrictions that stand as among the nation’s toughest\\n\\n“he’s the only person in the race who’s led on this issue” said o’malley spokeswoman haley morris\\n\\nlooking to the general election some guncontrol measures are popular especially with the coalition of swingstate latinos african americans and young and suburban women the democratic nominee would need to win the white house\\n\\n“there is no more powerful force in an election than the suburban mother and you don’t find a lot of suburban mothers that are against some sort of commonsense gun control” said mo \\xadelleithee a former clinton adviser and democratic strategist who now directs the georgetown institute of politics and public service\\n\\nother democrats argue that clinton has nothing to lose sen timothy m kaine dva said the nra has become a “paper tiger” noting the elections he’s won despite the nra’s vocal opposition\\n\\n“i think she has no illusion that even if she didn’t say a word about guns the nra would be out there blasting her to say she had a conspiratorial plan to work with the un to take everybody’s guns away so why not go headon on an issue that will improve safety” kaine said\\n\\na survey this year by the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research found that \\xa0percent favor requiring background checks for all gun sales including \\xa0percent of gun owners but polling is much more closely divided on other gun restrictions and does not account for the high intensity among guncontrol opponents\\n\\ndavid “mudcat” saunders a democratic strategist based in conservative rural virginia warned that clinton’s focus on guns could taint the entire democratic ticket including candidates for state and local offices\\n\\n“never in the history of the democratic party have they started a gun debate that didn’t cost them numbers in the general election” said saunders who supports the candidacy of former senator jim webb dva “she’s trying to get to the left of bernie obviously but i think it’ll hurt her in the long run — and it’ll cost anybody on the down ticket in the south and in rural america”\\n\\nin her  presidential campaign clinton stayed nearly silent on guns an exception was after obama’s “cling to guns” comment surfaced when she attacked him as being “elitist” and fondly recalled her father teaching her to shoot as a little girl at her grandfather’s pennsylvania lake house\\n\\nhoward wolfson for many years a top clinton aide before going to work for bloomberg said clinton’s avoidance of guns in  should not be mistaken for a lack of interest in gun control\\n\\n“i started working for her back in  and she talked about it back then” wolfson said “as a senator from new york it was something that was important to her i think in the wake of newtown and charleston it’s more resonant in our political culture”\\n\\nin recent months clinton’s speechwriters and policy staff have sought counsel from bloomberg’s group everytown for gun safety erika soto lamb \\xadeverytown’s spokeswoman said clinton’s focus on the issue is “striking”\\n\\n“knowing how hard we tried in  to get republican nominee mitt romney or obama to say

       " 'trump and advisers remain split on how far to move toward the middle ten days after he appointed new campaign leadership donald trump and many of his closest aides and allies remain divided on whether to adopt more mainstream stances or stick with the hardline conservative positions at the core of his candidacy according to people involved in the discussions\\n\\ntrump has been flooded with conflicting advice about where to land with the tensions vividly illustrated this week as the gop nominee publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his signature issue immigration\\n\\na particular flash point has been whether to forcibly deport an estimated  million illegal immigrants from the country a move trump long advocated but is now reconsidering\\n\\n“he has been listening to a wide range of opinions on that” said former new york mayor rudy giuliani who has been at trump’s side nearly constantly over the past week “as you might imagine there are different opinions on this even in his campaign in a very thoughtful way he’s trying to figure what the right position is”\\n\\n“by the way” giuliani added “that’s what everybody criticized him for in the past that he’s not able to do that he actually is able to do that”\\n\\nthe conversations in recent days have featured voices from a range of republican views all jockeying to tilt the businessman’s politics in their direction according to those involved trump tends to echo the words of the last person with whom he spoke making direct access to him even more valuable the people said speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions\\n\\nthose pushing trump to soften his stances and tone — and who have gained immense influence in recent days — include giuliani new jersey gov chris christie and former fox news chief roger ailes a longtime ally who has no formal role with the campaign but talks to the candidate frequently and attended a strategy session last weekend at recent private fundraisers many republican donors have also urged trump to adopt a different pitch and rethink his priorities\\n\\ntrump ‘softening’ on immigration many supporters don’t seem to mind\\n\\nmeanwhile trump continues to discuss immigration policy with sen jeff sessions ala who is seen as the populist force behind much of his candidacy while he has defended and encouraged trump’s deliberations sessions is considered a balancing force against more centrist appeals so is new campaign chief executive stephen bannon the former head of breitbart news the hardcharging conservative website\\n\\ntrump was joined on the trail this week by giuliani and sessions along with stephen miller a former aide to sessions who has become a welltrusted confidant his new yorkbased children continue to play an outsize role\\n\\nbut any suggestion of change has alarmed some conservatives and ardent backers firebrand commentator ann coulter declared this week that it was “a mistake” for trump to consider abandoning his support for mass deportations and said his tone “sounds very consultant to me”\\n\\nthe backandforth over immigration comes amid broader efforts by trump to reach out to voters beyond the disaffected whites who compose his base including events such as a roundtable friday with hispanic business leaders in las vegas trump also lashed out this week at his democratic rival hillary clinton for accusing him of appealing to racist elements repeatedly labeling her a “bigot” because he says her policies don’t help minorities\\n\\nlast year trump cast illegal immigrants as being mostly violent criminals and he rolled out an immigration plan that embraced ideas that had long dwelled at the fringes of the gop no longer granting citizenship to children born in the united states to illegal immigrants constructing a massive wall along the border with mexico and perhaps restricting some legal forms of immigration in interviews trump added that he would form a “deportation force” to remove the millions of immigrants living in the country illegally\\n\\nbut saturday trump asked a panel of hispanic advisers for alternate ideas and made clear that he was willing to change on the issue the next day newly installed campaign manager kellyanne conway who has advised gop candidates for years on how to win over swing voters said in a cnn interview that trump’s position on creating a deportation force was “to be determined”\\n\\nover the next few days trump took a variety of positions that created a frenzy of confusion over where exactly he stands on tuesday trump said he was open to “softening” the rules for the millions of immigrants who came to the country illegally but are living peaceful and prosperous lives only to say thursday that his position is “hardening”\\n\\nat an immigrationfocused town hall in texas on tuesday which was later broadcast on fox news trump repeatedly polled his audience on what he should do allowing his internal conflicts to play out publicly\\n\\n“can we go through a process or do you think they have to get out” he asked the audience “tell me i mean i don’t know you tell me”\\n\\ntrump provided the crowd a sympathetic portrait of a theoretical illegal immigrant who has been in the country more than a decade building a life with children and a stable job he repeatedly asked if that sort of person should be allowed to stay or be kicked out of the country getting results that were often difficult to measure at one point trump asked who in the crowd wanted all illegal immigrants thrown out even the lawabiding ones and a man stood up and bellowed “i do”\\n\\nfox news’s sean hannity then asked trump “you heard from the audience what does your gut tell you you want to do”\\n\\n“well look this is like a poll this is like a poll” trump said “and i love the guy that stood up and said — where is that guy i love this guy that’s my guy i mean i get it i get it and i understand what you’re saying but this is sort of like a poll and this is what i’m getting all over the country”\\n\\ntrump’s often contradictory comments on deportations came during interviews with fox news or cnn not during his campaign rallies for two weeks trump has been reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter a machine he had long cursed as the week progressed his control slipped and he went offscript more often — saying at a rally in ohio on monday that some urban areas are more dangerous than war zones and making a joke in tampa on wednesday about clinton being medicated\\n\\nthis week the campaign twice started to plan an event where trump could give an immigration speech — an opportunity for him to settle on a position and document it — only to cancel without a clear explanation\\n\\ninside donald trump’s new strategy to counter the view of many that he is racist\\n\\ntrump’s comment about being open to “softening” laws to help illegal immigrants came tuesday the same day coulter released her new book “in trump we trust” in which she writes that anything trump does could be forgiven “except change his immigration policies” during an msnbc interview that night coulter was obviously frustrated and threatened to cancel her book tour if the candidate clearly changed his position\\n\\n“i think this is a mistake i’ve thought he’s made other mistakes and i’ve given him constructive criticism when i think he makes a mistake” she said “i think this is a mistake”\\n\\nmsnbc’s chris matthews asked “does he take your criticism”\\n\\n“um” coulter responded “i haven’t had a lot but yeah no he does listen to people and i’m not advising him or anything but i did write this magnificent book”\\n\\nby wednesday coulter seemed confident again in trump’s candidacy as she attended a book party in washington and told bloomberg news’s joshua green “my worship for him is like the people of north korea worship their dear leader — blind loyalty once he gave that mexican rapist speech i’ll walk across glass for him that’s basically it \\u2009\\u2009 i’ll criticize him and i have but it’s all minor stylistic stuff we all want to shoot him at various times”\\n\\nthursday trump took a different tone in an interview with cnn’s anderson cooper and said that he foresees “a lot of people being deported” although he admitted such deportations could not all happen at once trump also doubled down on the notion that a majority of illegal immigrants are violent criminals who will be the first to go\\n\\n“and there are probably millions of them but certainly hundreds of thousands” he said “big numbers they’re out they’re out”\\n\\nat one point cooper asked trump “so if you haven’t committed a crime and you’ve been here for  years and you have a family here you have a job here will you be deported”\\n\\n“we’re going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border” trump replied describing that strength in detail “and then we’re going to see what happens but there is a very good chance the answer could be yes we’re going to see what happens”',\n",

would stay in a rental apartment in manhattan and wear a gps monitoring device and one more thing mr zarrab would pay for   guards to ensure that he did not flee and to escort him to and from the

extremely wealthy defendants particularly those from overseas are testing courts by proposing to live in   gilded cages while they await their fate prosecutors vigorously objected to mr zarrab’s being allowed to face trial under such conditions telling a federal judge in manhattan that the proposed plan would allow a rich defendant to build “a personal jail for himself” in a manhattan apartment “staffed by a firm on his payroll ” “zarrab’s proposed bail conditions” the government said “are an attempt to use his tremendous wealth to obscure the flight risk through a facade of security that is beyond the reach of all but a small subset of fabulously wealthy defendants ” mr zarrab’s lawyer benjamin brafman has sharply disputed the government’s position saying that at the time of his arrest

detention is predominantly based on wealth” said inimai m chettiar a lawyer at the brennan center for justice who runs an initiative to end mass incarceration joshua norkin a lawyer at the legal aid society of new york said the elaborate bail package that was being proposed for mr zarrab and that was granted to mr ng should remind judges in the state court system that they have the tools to release   people “on alternative and more creative forms of bail and they’re failing to do it ” the cases of wealthy defendants’ receiving special bail conditions are not limited to international defendants in  marc s dreier a manhattan lawyer who pleaded guilty to running an elaborate scheme that defrauded hedge funds and other investors of  million was granted a  million bond pending trial and remained in his east side apartment secured by electronic monitoring and armed security guards which his family paid for mr dreier prosecutors said used his criminal proceeds to support a lavish lifestyle including ownership of the apartment property in the hamptons a valuable art collection and an  million yacht in a written opinion the judge in the case jed s rakoff acknowledged concerns that such an arrangement for mr dreier gave people of means “an opportunity for release that poorer people could never obtain ” many kinds of bail conditions favored the rich judge rakoff said and conversely there were many defendants who were too poor to afford even the most modest of bail bonds or financial conditions of release “this is a serious flaw in our system” he wrote still he added “it is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who for whatever reason can provide reasonable assurance against flight ” one unusual condition set by judge rakoff was that mr dreier had to consent in writing to the use of “reasonable force” by the armed guards in case he tried to flee mr dreier later was sentenced to  years in prison the debate last fall over mr ng’s bail touched on similar issues mr ng a chinese real estate magnate with a net worth of about   billion owned private airplanes and had passports from at least three countries the government said in a bail hearing a prosecutor daniel c richenthal argued that mr ng who has pleaded not guilty had no family or other ties in the united states “there is no reason for him to remain” mr richenthal said “literally zero    bond is meaningless to him  million is meaningless to him ” the judge vernon s broderick ultimately ruled that there were conditions that could assure mr ng’s appearance in court and over the government’s objection granted the  million bail package including home confinement with    security the monitoring of his phone calls and other strict conditions that he detailed in an order the latest case involves mr zarrab who has pleaded not guilty to charges that include conspiring to violate the united states sanctions on iran the case has been widely watched in turkey in  mr zarrab was detained by the turkish authorities in a broad corruption investigation of businessmen with ties to recep tayyip erdogan then prime minister and now turkey’s president the office of preet bharara the united states attorney for the southern district of new york has asked that the judge richard m berman deny bail to mr zarrab saying evidence of his participation in the charged offenses was “overwhelming” and claiming mr zarrab misled a court officer regarding his international travel and his assets mr bharara’s office noted mr zarrab had amassed “a considerable fortune” citing evidence of his ownership in about  properties seven sea vessels  luxury automobiles a private airplane and over  million in artwork mr zarrab’s lawyer mr brafman has argued in court papers that his client who was born in iran and moved to turkey as an infant is not a risk to flee mr brafman asked the judge not to detain his client “simply because he is wealthy and lacks ties to the united states” and he argued that the bail proposal “removes any possible concern of flight ” “mr zarrab is a husband and a father who is committed to his family” mr brafman wrote “and would not countenance life as a fugitive ”',\n",

york city dollar of course not it’s the same us dollar \\nwe contend that there is only one way to measure the value of the dollar look at its price in gold as of friday that is  milligrams \\nand how do you measure the value of an ounce of gold let’s make an analogy to gold’s abundance we content that gold is the most abundant commodity with the exceptions of air and water how is that we measure abundance not by absolute quantity but by a ratio of stocks to flows it would take all the gold mines in the world many decades to produce the amount of gold now known to be held in human hands which number we believe is underestimated substantially no other commodity except silver comes remotely close to this \\nthe approach to measuring gold’s value is similar the value of the next ounce n is measured relative to the prior n let’s look at water to contrast with gold \\nsuppose you’re walking through the arizona desert in july the temperature might be  degrees fahrenheit c you get so thirsty that you could die very quickly you walk up to someone selling gallon jugs of water what would you pay for the first \\nit’s worth nothing less than your life \\nhow about the second you will need it to walk back to civilization the third a spare the fourth zero zilch nil \\nvalue  ∞ value   value   \\nthe value of each unit of water is not merely lower than the previous unit but massively lower \\nfor gold you knew this was coming the value is flat that is anyone will happily accept the fourth gold coin just as the first and the  th the same as the  st  \\nthis is an important feature for money is it not it means that any business no matter how large can keep its books using gold even as the balance sheet grows the value of the unit of account — the numeraire — remains constant \\nkind of like how engineers rely on the constant length of the meter stick no matter how tall the building imagine if they used some sort of rubber band to measure length and the higher the skyscraper the shorter the rubber band shrank construction above one story would be impossible \\nwell if the unit of account varied in value as water does economic calculation beyond a simple subsistence farm would be impossible \\nread on for the only true picture of the fundamentals of the monetary metals but first here’s the graph of the metals’ prices \\nthe prices of gold and silver \\nnext this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio it didn’t move this week \\nthe ratio of the gold price to the silver price \\nfor each metal we will look at a graph of the basis and cobasis overlaid with the price of the dollar in terms of the respective metal it will make it easier to provide brief commentary the dollar will be represented in green the basis in blue and cobasis in red \\nhere is the gold graph \\nthe gold basis and cobasis and the dollar price \\ncould the scarcity ie cobasis the red line be rolling over it’s too early to tell but bears watching \\nthe fundamental price of gold barely budged though it’s about twenty bucks below the market price \\nnow let’s look at silver \\nthe silver basis and cobasis and the dollar price \\nlast week we asked \\nthe big question this week does the buying of metal remain strong or is this just another flash in the pan \\nso far the buying has held up the fundamental price is up just about as much as the market price \\nlet’s put this in perspective below is a graph showing not the prices of the metals but premium vs discount the green region at the bottom represents discount and thus a safe place to buy the red region at the top represents danger as you’re overpaying \\nnote that silver has not been offered at a discount in quite some time this does not mean that the price has to crash tomorrow morning but it does mean you’re paying a speculative premium maybe you will get a chance to unload to the next speculator at an even higher price but maybe not \\ngold was in discount through around the end of april it tipped into discount at the end of august it’s now selling at a premium though not a large one \\nthe premium on gold and silver

       " 'few good options in trump arsenal to counter defiant north korea washington reuters  despite his campaign vows to take a tougher line with north korea president donald trump’s restrained public reaction to pyongyang’s first ballistic missile launch on his watch underscores that he has few good options to curb its missile and nuclear programs the responses under consideration  which range from additional sanctions to us shows of force to beefedup missile defense according to one administration official  do not seem to differ significantly so far from the north korea playbook followed by trump’s predecessor barack obama even the idea of stepping up pressure on china to rein in a defiant north korea has been tried  to little avail  by successive administrations but beijing is showing no signs of softening its resistance under a new us president who has bashed them on trade currency and the contested south china sea more dramatic responses to north korea’s missile tests would be direct military action or negotiations but neither appears to be on the table  the first because it would risk regional war the latter because it would be seen as rewarding pyongyang for bad behavior and neither would offer certain success “trump’s options are limited” said bonnie glaser an asia expert at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington trump’s initial public comments on saturday on the test launch of what was believed to be an intermediaterange musudanclass missile were unexpectedly measured  and brief  compared to earlier bluster about another us adversary iran since he took office on january  “i just want everybody to understand and fully know that the united states of america is behind japan our great ally  percent” trump told reporters in palm beach florida speaking in a solemn tone alongside visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe the us president did not mention north korea or signal any retaliatory plans for what was widely seen as an early effort to test the new administration by contrast trump tweeted “it won’t happen” in january after north korean leader kim jong un said the north was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile white house adviser stephen miller insisted on abc’s “this week” that trump’s onesentence statement was an “important show of solidarity” with japan he told “fox news sunday” the administration was going to bolster its allies in the region against the “increasing hostility” of north korea while no one can rule out that trump might still take to twitter with harsh rhetoric as he often does some analysts said his relatively subdued initial statement could show that aides have convinced him not to be baited by pyongyang into issuing threats that would be hard to carry out especially while his north korea strategy is still being formulated trump’s aides have said that they will take a more assertive approach than the obama policy dubbed “strategic patience” which involved gradually scaling up sanctions and diplomatic pressure and essentially waiting out the north korean leadership but the new administration has been vague about how it would do this the trump administration had been expecting a north korean “provocation” and will consider a full range of options in response but they would be calibrated to show us resolve while avoiding escalation the us official said speaking on condition of anonymity the stakes would be higher however if nuclearcapable north korea makes good on its threat to test an icbm of a kind that could someday hit the united states analysts said trump and his aides are likely to weigh new us sanctions to tighten financial controls an increase in naval and air assets and joint military exercises in and around the korean peninsula and accelerated installation of new missile defense  systems in south korea the official said trump has also made clear that he believes china has not done enough to use its influence to help rein in pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic programs the us official told reuters that trump would now step up pressure on beijing but acknowledged that there were limits to how far china would go especially in enforcing sanctions because of its own interests in avoiding destabilization of north korea it remains to be seen however whether the new administration might go a step beyond obama’s approach and focus on imposing “secondary sanctions” on firms and entities that help north korea’s weapons programs many of which are in china also unclear is whether trump’s phone call last week with chinese president xi jinping in which the us president backed  away from his threat to break from america’s longstanding “one china” policy would engender greater cooperation from beijing on north korea “beijing has enormous leverage over pyongyang thanks to being one of its only trading partners and in fact could not survive without chinese economic assistance” said harry kazianis director of defense studies at the conservative   center for the national interest riki ellison who heads the missile defense advocacy alliance an industry group said trump should also move quickly to beef up missile defense in both south korea and japan  for which the obama administration has already laid much of the groundwork “he cannot ignore this” he said “it has to be swift” north korea’s repeated missile launches prompted washington and seoul to agree to deploy a terminal high altitude area defense thaad antimissile battery in south korea later this year a system strongly opposed by beijing which worries that its powerful radar undermines its own security ',\n",

“dangerously incoherent” in a speech on thursday that cast her republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure in remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and oneliners to attack trump’s policies and character suggesting trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the white house simply because “somebody got under his very thin skin”  “donald trump’s ideas are not just different they are dangerously incoherent” she said to a room of supporters in san diego california “they’re not even really ideas just a series of bizarre rants personal feuds and outright lies” clinton the frontrunner in the race to become the democratic presidential nominee delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the nov  election against likely rival trump and away from bernie sanders a us senator from vermont who is continuing his longshot bid for the nomination clinton was speaking in san diego ahead of california’s june  primary election democratic party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose trump who managed to knock out all  rivals for the republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults trump revels in referring to clinton as “crooked hillary” and dredging up the infidelities of her husband bill clinton the former president clinton’s remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toetotoe with him in scornful putdowns “he says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the miss universe pageant in russia” she said as the crowd guffawed and she suggested trump would run the us economy “like one of his casinos” during her speech clinton predicted trump who has been deeply critical of clinton’s foreign policy record would take to his twitter account to insult her and he did “bad performance by crooked hillary clinton” ran one posting during the speech which included a typo “reading poorly from the telepromter she doesn’t even look presidential” trump has said previously that clinton is distorting his actual policies amid the laugh lines clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state in particular her role advising president barack obama during the mission to kill al qaeda leader osama bin laden to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious “he praises dictators like vladimir putin and picks fights with our friends including the british prime minister the mayor of london the german chancellor the president of mexico and the pope” clinton said listing some of the allies with whom trump has verbally sparred in the last year obama who has also been repeatedly mocked by trump has criticized trump as being ignorant or cavalier about world affairs and has said that trump’s rise has “rattled” foreign leaders trump has talked tough on foreign policy he has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by obama trump has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country and said he would ask members of the nation nato alliance to “pay up” or “get out” he has said he would sit down with north korean leader kim jong un to try to stop pyongyang’s nuclear program clinton derided these and other positions promising she would do a better job keeping the united states safe standing in front of a backdrop of  large us flags an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events clinton painted the election as a choice between “two very different visions” “one that’s angry afraid and based on the idea that america is fundamentally weak and in decline” she said summing up trumpism “the other is hopeful generous and confident in the knowledge that america is great just like we always have been” trump has criticized clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her  stint as secretary of state including the sept   attack by islamist militants on a us diplomatic facility in benghazi libya that killed the us ambassador and three other americans he cites

after her speech though he also criticized clinton’s foreign policy “i agree  that donald trump’s foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible” sanders said in a statement in criticizing clinton sanders cited her vote for the war in iraq calling it “the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history” and said “she has been a proponent of regime change as in libya without thinking through the consequences” in assailing each other’s suitability for the white house clinton and trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next month’s party conventions that

we’re still discovering who he is he often does things we can’t predict we’re not clever enough to predict what he’ll do” said shen dingli a professor at shanghai’s elite fudan university trump upset china even before taking office taking a call from taiwan president tsai ingwen overturning decades of precedent of no highlevel official contacts between the united states and an island china considers to be a wayward province  while china has worked hard to get trump to understand the importance of taiwan to the chinaus relationship it has never seriously expected washington to stop selling it weapons provision for which is explicitly made in us law “the us selling weapons to taiwan is routine” said shen “they’re selling much less than before and that’s much better so i don’t think there’s anything too terrible about that” still the risks around taiwan are profound  china’s defense ministry responding to the us weapons sales said taiwan was the “most important most sensitive core issue” between the united states and china the arms sale came hot on the heels of a us senate committee approving a bill calling for the resumption of port visits to taiwan by the us navy for the first time since washington ditched taipei and established ties with beijing in  while china’s defense ministry registered its opposition to the bill on thursday spokesman wu qian pointed out that as long as they respect each other’s core concerns the chinese and us militaries can be an “engine of stability” for the two countries shi yinhong who heads the center for american studies at beijing’s renmin university and has advised the government on diplomacy said it was important people are realistic about the challenges china and the united states face “perhaps people appraised too highly the xitrump meeting although the atmosphere was very good there were still real problems there” shi said referring to the florida summit “maybe you can say that chinaus relations have gone back to being normal” shi added “trump has no patience and nobody can be surprised that he’s pushed certain issues to the fore” ',\n",
       " 'jane fonda the reluctant fashionista  the new york times when the model grace hartzel opened tom ford’s spring  show in a striking shag haircut the inspiration was unmistakable  —   at least to those over  who watched mr ford’s extravaganza the hairdo paid homage to the one jane fonda made supercool as the times square hooker bree daniels in the  movie “klute ” alexander mcqueen also cited ms fonda as a motivating force of “deliverance” his spring  collection which has gone down in fashion history for its dance presentation inspired by ms fonda’s performance in the  drama “they shoot horses don’t they” in her late ’s heyday ms fonda played her fair share of     roles off screen she was the ultrachic paris wife of the director roger vadim and was a   fixture at shows staged by his friends coco chanel hubert de givenchy and yves saint laurent recently speaking by phone from a film location in colorado ms fonda  firmly denied her style pedigree “i am not a fashionista” she said ms fonda’s political activism often overshadowed her status as a sartorial influencer highlighting it however is her collection of couture italian    and lavish screen costumes that will be auctioned on friday at julien’s auctions in los angeles about five of the items are   but when asked if she had considered donating an atelier versace gown a valentino something even her stripy workout leotard to perhaps the met costume institute she offered an unyielding “no ” ms fonda is auctioning her possessions  items in all mostly clothing in a housecleaning exercise “i had to do jobs to pay for my storage” she said of the units she had maintained since her  divorce from the media mogul ted turner “because ted did not like to carry a lot of luggage on his jet  —   it was too burdensome  —   i would have to buy things in bulk” for their travels to his many properties parting with mementos was tough yet ultimately worthwhile “lighter” she said of her sense of relief on clearing the space here ms fonda tells the stories behind some pieces going under the gavel ms fonda wore the yves saint laurent pantsuit below when she claimed the oscar as best actress in  the somber black ensemble with its sharp   jacket reflected the communist sympathies she had developed before buying the suit in  ms fonda had just given birth to her daughter vanessa vadim and during her pregnancy said she had grown horrified watching french television broadcasts of the attacks on north vietnam by the time of the oscars ms fonda was divorcing mr vadim and though she had hung on to her haute couture she had exchanged her new wave lifestyle for a     antiwar lecture tour across the united states the hollywood establishment feared she would use the oscars as another stop on it “i wanted to make a speech about vietnam” ms fonda admitted of the ceremony instead she listened to her father henry fonda who advised her to refrain from politicking at the podium “he said to me ‘just say ‘there is a lot to be said but tonight is not the time’ so i did and i wore something that made a statement it was not a time for showy dresses it was a time for seriousness ” before yeezy there was fonda ms fonda introduced her own line of luxe exercise apparel in  after her workout book and its video adaptation both fronted by an image of her in this black and red leotard had dominated   lists for years though films like “flashdance” and “perfect” made aerobics gear au courant ms fonda’s namesake aerobics label proved too   and quickly folded the  pieces from atelier versace that ms fonda is auctioning are the standouts of the sale the garments run the gamut from her flamboyant oscar gowns to embellished couture that lesage the venerable paris embroidery house produced by channeling gianni versace’s inimitable   take on picasso’s rose period and robert delaunay’s abstract paintings many of the pieces were selected for ms fonda by mr versace after they met in  in the midst of divorcing her second husband tom hayden at the time she had controversially acquired breast implants and was dating a    italian soccer goalkeeper lorenzo caccialanza “i was in italy with him and i met gianni then” ms fonda recalled “gianni kind of took me under his wing and whenever i would do a red carpet he would supply my clothes he gave me dresses belts gloves and shoes he was very generous ” ms fonda sees no conflict between her political stances and her flaunting of versace a label that was often criticized for dressing supermodels in bondage numbers “i used to think ‘i have to be very serious’” she admitted “but being a feminist is not about the antithesis of being sexy or looking good ” as the daughter of a golden era hollywood actor ms fonda likely noticed as his contemporaries like lauren bacall and audrey hepburn often walked off film sets with their wardrobes the garments were made by skilled costume designers whose work was often on par with couturiers ms fonda continued the practice and three dresses by the   costume designer ann roth which she wore in the  film “rollover” are up for grabs “rollover” a financial thriller predated “wall street” and “the big short ” but it flopped “we couldn’t get the script right” ms fonda said although her life eventually reflected the part she had played  —   a film star who “gave it all up” to become the wife of an industrialist  —   she made good use of her glam wardrobe a decade after making the movie ms fonda quit acting and donned the   lace “rollover” gown to marry mr turner a sumptuous sequined velvet gown from the film went to the white house when ms fonda accompanied him to a  dinner for the emperor and empress of japan “i am very much in favor of wearing things more than once” ms fonda said two months went into the making of this schiaparelli couture gown which ms fonda wore at the  cannes film festival premiere of “youth ” paolo sorrentino’s drama in which ms fonda portrayed an aging starlet was competing for the palme d’or prize “jane was very proud of the movie and she wanted to make a special moment of the premiere” said a schiaparelli spokeswoman who worked on the dress with ms fonda and her stylist tanya gill so in a departure from the   versace dresses ms fonda has made her signature at cannes working the red carpet as a l’oréal paris spokeswoman the cosmetics

       " 'it turns out spending more probably does improve education  the new york times if you spend more on education will students do better educators politicians and unions have battled in court over that crucial question for decades most recently in a sweeping decision this fall in connecticut where a judge ordered the state to revamp nearly every facet of its education policies from graduation requirements to special education along with its school funding for many years research on the relationship between spending and student learning has been surprisingly inconclusive many other factors including student poverty parental education and the way schools are organized contribute to educational results teasing out the specific effect of money spent is methodologically difficult opponents of increased school funding have seized on that ambiguity to argue that for schools money doesn’t matter  —   and therefore more money isn’t needed but new     research suggests that conclusion is mistaken money really does matter in education which could provide fresh momentum for more lawsuits and judgments like the connecticut decision the study published by the national bureau of economic research in july was conducted by the economists julien lafortune and jesse rothstein of the university of california at berkeley and diane whitmore schanzenbach of northwestern they examined student test scores in  states that have changed the way they fund schools since  usually in response to a lawsuit like connecticut’s and compared them with those in  states that haven’t while no two states did exactly the same thing they all had the effect of increasing funding for the poorest districts the   time frame is important that’s when courts changed how they think about states’ obligations to public schoolchildren previously nearly all school funding lawsuits focused on the question of “equity”  —   did disadvantaged students receive funding equal to that of their   peers the problem with that perspective was the answer could be “yes” even if funding was too low across the board starting with a  court case in kentucky courts started asking about “adequacy” instead were school districts getting enough money which might require giving extra money to districts that enroll many      students “there’s been this wave of school finance reform across the country over the last few decades” mr rothstein said “i think it’s fair to say it’s the largest reform aimed at equity since school desegregation and we really didn’t know what the impacts were there’s now growing evidence from my work and from others that those reforms did lead to improved achievement and improved outcomes for children in   school districts ” mr lafortune mr rothstein and ms schanzenbach also solved a difficult methodological problem that had plagued school finance researchers for decades more money isn’t an end unto itself  —   the goal is to produce better results but before the recent widespread adoption of the common core state standards every state had its own standards and related tests that made it hard to compare academic results from one state to another the researchers took advantage of the one test that is taken by a representative sample of schoolchildren nationwide the national assessment of educational progress or naep which is administered by the department of education although naep results are usually published only for whole states and a small number of large urban school districts the researchers got the education department to let them analyze individual student scores those results include information on the  ’s race and income as well as school district attended the researchers could compare performance in poor and wealthy districts before and after changes in spending they found a consistent pattern in the long run over comparable time frames states that send additional money to their   school districts see more academic improvement in those districts than states that don’t the size of the effect was significant the changes bought at least twice as much achievement per dollar as a   experiment that decreased class sizes in the early grades another paper published this year in the quarterly journal of economics looked at the same question through a different lens that study examined   outcomes like how long students stayed in school and how much they earned as adults for students in districts with and without   funding changes here too researchers saw gains with more money spent that study was conducted by c kirabo jackson of northwestern rucker c johnson from the university of california at berkeley and claudia persico then a graduate student at northwestern and now an assistant professor at the university of wisconsin they examined outcomes for about   people born between  and  and found that for poor children a  percent increase in   spending each year of elementary and secondary school was associated with wages that were nearly  percent higher a drop in the incidence of adult poverty and roughly six additional months of schooling “the notion that spending doesn’t matter is just not true” mr jackson said “we found that exposure to higher levels of public   spending when you’re in school has a pretty large beneficial effect on the adult outcomes of kids and that those effects are much more pronounced for children from   families ” donald j trump’s recent nomination of betsy devos a wealthy republican   and longtime supporter of private school vouchers to be secretary of education probably won’t help the cause of those who want to use this research to spend more in   public school districts but because  percent of all   funding comes from state and local sources the decision won’t be up to her it will lie with state lawmakers who now have a better reason to invest more in school districts educating children who have the least money what the studies do not offer notes jennifer alexander chief executive of the connecticut coalition for achievement now a group that backs charter schools and other overhauls is robust information on the best use of the money “how money is spent is equally important” she said “and i don’t think we have enough information about that from these studies ” mr rothstein cautioned that the idea that states could erase the achievement gap between poor and middle class students by simply cutting a few checks was unrealistic “there has been a tendency to expect magic from these reforms” he said but a change does not have to solve a problem completely he said to be valuable “we should consider them successful if they contribute in a meaningful way to closing the gap” mr rothstein said “we have to make some assessment as to whether it’s enough to matter but enough to matter can be quite a bit less than totally eliminating it ”',\n",

       " 'why was this natural medicinal substance just banned by the dea posted by eddie if you’ve been keeping up with alternative media outlets the past couple weeks you probably know that the dea just classified kratom a tropical deciduous tree with leaves used for various medicinal purposes   a schedule  substance this puts it in the same class as heroin   vendors are already struggling to import it and some have gone into hiding   kratom has been called a lifesaver for sufferers of mental or physical conditions made worse by pharmaceutical drugs despite this and despite the harms caused by opiates the scandalridden dea has set its sights on fighting yet another helpful natural substance proven to work better for the treatment of various conditions than its pharmaceutical counterparts an uprising began the moment the dea announced the decision activists and kratom users everywhere are refusing to take it lying down and are working to correct the false image this classification paints of a misunderstood medicine blurring the line by classifying it schedule  the dea is essentially telling us kratom is as bad as heroin a little research reveals that not only is it nowhere near as bad as heroin or other opiates but it can be used to treat opiate addiction anything that alters the mind is a drug and by making classifications like this the dea is seriously blurring the line between beneficial and harmful drugs while confusing the public and proliferating ignorance nature produces countless mindaltering chemicals we’re supposed to use to heal the body and elevate the mind and soul in this day and age people are becoming aware of the power of nature to heal many of the problems created by man this unjustified action against one of many beneficial natural substances serves only to expose the fact that the dea is out of touch with the rest of the world no longer a legitimate authority cassius kamarampi writes that we have no reason to consider the dea’s authority legitimate in the wake of their recent scandals   one scandal which broke wide open in the media involved agents holding sex parties with prostitutes in columbia supplied by local cartels   this ultimately forced the head of the dea michelle m leonhart to step down   it’s as if the agency wants to bring attention away from their misdeeds and onto the latest supposedly dangerous drug perhaps they intend for the backlash to make people forget their scandals and continue to bicker about which drugs the government should or shouldn’t let the masses use if this is the case there’s one thing they didn’t consider activists don’t forget you can’t expect independent thinkers to excuse the scandals of an agency that targets them with unfair laws ultimately this classification will drive researchers and activists to expose more corruption within an agency that can no longer be taken seriously but is nonetheless dangerous to those who oppose it it’s up to us the masses aren’t always quick to question the ulterior motives of government agencies they’ve been conditioned to believe exist for the greater good this is one reason the backlash from the activist community is so strong we know by this point that it’s up to us to make a change the struggle against an unjustified classification of a natural medicinal substance has to be particularly coherent well organized and founded upon a strong sense of cohesion to make up for the apathy in society we won’t have much help and we may find ourselves in opposition to people who know no better than to believe what the government or dea tells them but it helps to know there are millions around the world who like us are fighting for the positive change we know we can have we just have to strive for it together kratom’s medicinal uses let’s take a look at some of kratom’s reported medicinal uses the information below doesn’t paint a complete picture of what it can do but the uses we’ll learn about are enough to convince anyone it shouldn’t be illegal or considered as dangerous as heroin according to natural blaze  kratom isn’t an opiate but functions similarly by attaching to activating opioid receptors in the brain – without the harsh side effects   among other benefits chewing on kratom leaves can alleviate chronic pain and anxiety as well as help in the struggle against addiction   this is due to the leaves’ natural euphoric effects which again come without the negative side effects of opiates   according to organicfactsnet  kratom’s benefits include lowering blood pressure boosting metabolism relieving pain improving the immune system increasing sexual energy easing anxiety preventing diabetes eliminating stress and inducing a healthier state of sleep   kratom or mitragyna speciose is native to southeast asia where it’s used for its medicinal properties   it’s no stranger to being banned it was banned in thailand despite that it’s indigenous there and used regardless   it’s described as a natural opium substitute with unique chemical compounds and nutrients found in its leaves   it contains a wide range of alkaloids and other organic substances and despite being banned it’s still widely used in thailand studies estimate that up to  of males in the country chew anywhere from  leaves daily   as a less harmful substitute for opium it exhibits no addictive qualities   this in itself makes kratom a great treatment for addiction and other physical or mental health problems   which is more than we can say about most of big pharma’s drugs organic facts provides an indepth description of each of kratom’s medicinal properties paraphrased below pain relief kratom is best known for relieving pain in a way similar to opiates   this is due to the analgesic properties of the alkaloids and nutrients in its leaves which impact the hormonal system and relieve pain quickly   the alkaloids and nutrients increase the amount of serotonin and dopamine released into the body this can either mask or alleviate pain   the alkaloids essentially dull the body’s pain receptors   and this opiumlike quality is considered kratom’s “most important application”   improving immune system health the alkaloids also have a “major” combinative effect on the strength and resilience of the immune system   and research that’s still being checked suggests chewing on the leaves can prevent illness or reduce its severity   if the dea’s ban were lifted research could continue unhindered and the truth could eventually reach a mainstream audience improving sexual drive many see kratom as an aphrodisiac and fertility booster   the extra energy and blood flow received from the leaves can help increase fertility reenergize a tired libido and improve duration as well as conception rates   treating anxiety  mood swings the leaves are often chewed by sufferers of chronic stress depression anxiety and mood swings for their anxiolytic antianxiety properties   chewing them can also regulate hormones in the body providing relief from symptoms of chemical imbalance without the need for dangerous pharmaceutical drugs   helping recover from addiction kratom has been used to cure addiction to opiates and other harmful substances for thousands of years   opium addiction has been a major problem in countless cultures throughout history since chewing kratom leaves provides a similar sensation to opium without the comedown or other negative side effects addicts trying to get clean consider it a “tolerable solution” that helps them cover and cope with symptoms of withdrawal   keeping the heart healthy studies connect chewing kratom leaves with a drop in blood pressure the leaves’ chemical components reduce inflammation throughout the body when they impact its hormones   the affected areas include the arteries and blood vessels   it can even prevent serious heart conditions such as stroke heart attack or atherosclerosis by relieving tension in the cardiovascular system   treating or preventing diabetes kratom’s effect on blood sugar levels isn’t as wellknown as its treatment for pain or addiction   limited research suggests the leaves’ alkaloids regulate the amount of insulin and glucose in the blood preventing the dangerous peaks and troughs often suffered by diabetics   because of this kratom could potentially prevent diabetes or help those who already suffer with it to manage it   side effects any mindaltering substance comes with its share of side effects but like cannabis kratom’s lack of serious or dangerous side effects is one of its most remarkable qualities the effects listed below are only common for first or second time users and they diminish as the body acclimates to regular use   they include fatigue nausea and constipation as well as a “kratom hangover” that can come with headaches or nausea the morning after the first or second use   this pales in comparison to what opium addicts experience and most would probably be glad to have a natural medicinal substance to help them through their recovery nature can’t be outlawed the following is my opinion and may or may not reflect the ideals of those who are more involved in the fight against kratom’s criminalization kratom’s recent classification can be likened in many ways to the marihuana tax act of the s the medicinal benefits of cannabis were wellknown during that time as it was used for medicine throughout the united states the benefits of hemp were also wellknown as it became apparent to billionaires with control over the media that they couldn’t make as much money from hemp as they could lumber cotton and other less easily replaceable resources they deemed cannabis the evil mexican marihuana and outlawed it with the help of heavily publicized propaganda campaigns kratom might not come with the array of industrial benefits provided by hemp feel free to correct me if it does but i’d imagine the government and dea have a similar intention in outlawing it the struggle for freedom as many have pointed out this latest development is just another instance in the overall struggle between government agencies and the people they try to control through oppressive and intimidating laws it represents the struggle for freedom in this case the freedom to use nature the way it’s intended without fear of persecution this includes the use of substances with medicinal uses big pharma can’t market the government’s efforts to stifle the use of these substances for the benefit of pharmaceutical companies or other industries aligned against them is futile as damian marley put it “people will always be who they want and that’s what really makes the world go ‘round” rather than fight it the dea should accept that the masses are slowly embracing natural approaches to treating curing and preventing disease they should also accept that the effort to suppress the use of any natural substance with proven benefits for the mind or body is futile in the big picture conclusion the struggle between the dea and sensible free thinkers is birthed from our resistance to their attempt to control or prevent the natural relationship between man and the psychoactive chemicals found in nature humans have interacted with natural mindaltering substances for centuries and despite how hard any government agency tries to prevent this interaction it will continue indefinitely because it exists for a reason the truth about kratom is already spreading as a result of the backlash from the dea’s decision if we can make people aware of its medicinal properties and inspire them to take action we can reverse a decision made out of negligence for the lives that will be affected by it criminalizing the innocent only creates crime where there was none and at this pivotal point in mankind’s evolution we should be past this kind of backward thinking sources “health benefits of

       " 'dear america stop supporting terrorists in syria and around the world st century wire says since  the united states government led by president barack obama has adopted an open policy of supporting an armed opposition in syria while certain officials have only recently admitted to arming and funding these militants evidence shows that the support has been pouring in through both covert means and official channels from the onset of the conflict we now know that those commonly referred to in the western media as  rebels  in syria are comprised mainly of religious extremists and designated terrorists despite this revelation the us uk france along with saudi arabia qatar and others have continued to back them and even go so far as to color them with political legitimacy   all in a grand effort to try and achieve regime change in syria it s not the first time either that washington has pursued this same policy of destablization in order to overthrow a foreign governmentpresident donald trump has an opportunity to reverse this backwards us policy will he capitalize on the opportunity to start anew or will the us revert back to its old deep state default position the passage of hawaii congresswomen tulsi gabbard s recently proposed piece of legislation entitled stop arming terrorists act would be positive move in that direction will president trump champion her billthe following is an open letter from writer steven sahiounie to the us government to the government of the united states of americai am asking my american government to stop supporting terrorists in syria the us government and media keep calling them  moderate rebels  but they are not  they were never moderate and many are not rebels by definition a  rebel  is rebelling against their own government  however many of the us backed  rebels  are not syrian and have no family ties to syria and have never been a citizen of syria for example how could a chinese citizen fight in a rebellion against the american government  by what right does a chinese citizen have to kill and maim in order to change the us government  it is wrong and makes no sensei would never advocate or support any armed attack or rebellion against the american government there are laws against murdering raping kidnapping and maiming people in usa  the same such laws exist in syria how could a democracy and a world leader like usa advocate murdering raping kidnapping and maiming innocent syrian peoplefrom the outset of violence and crimes in  syria in   the us backed  rebels  used sectarian slogans and carries out sectarian attacks and massacres syria is a secular form of government as is usa why would american leaders support the targeting of minorities in syria when the president of america is himself a minority why would the us government support the destruction on churches and mosques american s value religious freedom and equality of minorities yet the us backed  free syrian army  destroyed churches targeted christians attacked christian villages as well as targeting muslim minority sects with similar acts such as kessab ballouta mahardeh and maaloula among many othersthe us government sent weapons missiles special training equipment food medical supplies communications and satellite imagery to the free syrian army from  to  yet the current exodus of evacuees from east aleppo has not received even one loaf of bread from usa  while the us backed fsa had many warehouses full of food and medicines they have left behind as they retreated deeper into east aleppo finally the  rebels  who agreed to vacate recently have burned all the medical supplies and food storages which were the gifts of the american taxpayers so as to prevent the distribution of those  supplies to the starving masses who have fled east aleppo nowamerican citizens are currently very concerned about syrian refugees coming to usa who may have had ties to terrorism  the us backed  rebels  are exactly the type of people the american citizens should be afraid of as possible new neighbors living in their midst as settled refugees  they are the type of people who would chop off the head of their neighbor because his religion is not exactly the same as theirs  they are the type of people who are willing to take money from a foreign government for the purpose of destroying their own community  they are the type of people who do not value religious freedom or minority rights what would happen when the us backed  rebels  who may be settled in usa decide to rebel against the american government will the us president and congress call them  freedom fighters  or perhaps america s enemies will fund and support their armed attacks on the us government and civilianswe should all be united in our plea please stop supporting terrorism  in syria and around the worldsteven sahiouniewire special contributor steven sahiounie is an american citizen born in fresno

       " 'why palestinians want to sue britain  years since the balfour declaration why palestinians want to sue britain  years since the balfour declaration by ramzy baroud posted on november   by ramzy baroud \\nlast july the palestinian authority took the unexpected although belated step of seeking arab backing in suing britain over the balfour declaration that ‘declaration’ was the first ever explicit commitment made by britain and the west in general to establish a jewish homeland atop an existing palestinian homeland \\nit is too early to tell whether the arab league would heed the palestinian call  or if the pa would even follow through especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action \\nhowever it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the balfour declaration the  th anniversary of which will be commemorated on november   \\nbut who is balfour what is the balfour declaration and why does all of this matters today \\nbritain’s foreign secretary from late  arthur james balfour had pledged palestine to another people that promise was made on november   on behalf of the british government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the jewish community in britain walter rothschild \\nat the time britain was not even in control of palestine which was still part of the ottoman empire either way palestine was never balfour’s to so casually transfer to anyone else his letter read \\n“his majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonjewish communities in palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country” \\nhe concluded “i should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the zionist federation” \\nbalfour was hardly acting on his own true the declaration bears his name yet in reality he was a loyal agent of an empire with massive geopolitical designs not only concerning palestine alone but with palestine as part of a larger arab landscape \\nonly a year earlier another sinister document was introduced albeit secretly it was endorsed by another top british diplomat mark sykes and on behalf of france by françois georgespicot the russians were informed of the agreement as they too had received a piece of the ottoman cake \\nthe document indicated that once the ottomans were soundly defeated their territories including palestine would be split among the prospective victorious parties \\nthe sykespicot agreement  also known as the ‘asia minor agreement’ was signed in secret one hundred years ago two years into world war i it signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them \\nthe centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a china graph pencil the map largely determined the fate of the arabs dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines \\nthe improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors  along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the arab region purely on materialistic terms without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of cooperation and conflict \\npalestinians rebelled  marking a rebellion that has never ceased  years later and highlighting the horrific consequences of british colonialism and the eventual complete zionist takeover of palestine which is still felt after all of these years \\npaltry attempts to pacify palestinian anger were to no avail especially after the league of nations council in july  approved the terms of the british mandate over palestine—which was originally granted to britain in april —without consulting the palestinians at all in fact palestinians would disappear from the british and international radar only to reappear as negligible rioters troublemakers and obstacles to the joint britishzionist colonial concoctions \\ndespite occasional assurances to the contrary the british intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively jewish state in palestine was becoming clearer with time the balfour declaration was not merely an aberration but had indeed set the stage for the that followed three decades later \\nin fact that history remains in constant replay the zionists claimed palestine and renamed it ‘israel’ the british continue to support them although never ceasing to pay lipservice to the arabs and the palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps in the diaspora militarily occupied or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial \\nwhile balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunes that have befallen palestinians since he communicated his brief but infamous letter the notion that his ‘promise’ embodied complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the palestinian arab people—that very letter is handed from one generation of british diplomats to the next in the same way that palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations \\nthat injustice continues thus the perpetuation of the conflict what the british the early zionists the americans and subsequent israeli governments failed to understand and continue to ignore at their own peril is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in palestine and that palestinians will continue to resist as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago remain in place \\ndr ramzy baroud has been writing about the middle east for over  years he is an internationallysyndicated columnist a media consultant an author of several books and the founder of palestinechroniclecom

       " 'in trade stances toward china clinton and trump both signal a chill  the new york times hong kong  —   for asia the bad news this week was not that donald j trump detailed a   plan to toughen american trade policy especially toward china it was that hillary clinton’s campaign accused mr trump a few hours later of purloining her ideas noting that she favored similar action on those issues a strong dose of economic populism with an occasional sprinkling of geopolitics has suffused the trade plans of the leading american presidential candidates this year vying for votes mr trump and mrs clinton are each promising to do more to preserve american jobs at a time of slowing global economic growth and china  —   with its vast trade rising international influence and authoritarian government  —   is a natural target presidential candidates vow every four years to do more to help american workers facing competition from abroad after taking office they have consistently pursued more conciliatory trade policies toward china seeing a strategic benefit to warm relations with beijing but broad political distress this year over the loss of   working class jobs to global competition coupled with mounting concern about china’s increasingly assertive military posture suggest that the next president could actually follow through on the pledges if they do the policies could pose a real predicament for china and for other asian countries that depend on its economy millions of jobs in china and across the region require the continued willingness of the united states to rely overwhelmingly on imports to supply american families with everything from the clothes they wear to the smartphones they carry rapid economic growth in china and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country’s need for huge exports to the american market but china’s economy has recently slowed hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for china to maintain a large trade surplus with the united states selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys for years china has exported four times as much to the united states as it imports and it continues to do so “if there are tougher trade policies from the united states” said shen jianguang an economist at mizuho securities asia “that will dampen chinese exports ” the candidates plan to take direct aim at the two countries’ trade gap they want to label china as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets they want to file more trade cases against china and impose more tariffs they want to investigate how the chinese government subsidizes businesses they also want to rethink big trade deals mr trump wants to scrap the   partnership a   agreement between the united states and a group of countries mostly in asia mrs clinton’s campaign took a subtly different position saying that she opposed the agreement in its current form the asian countries involved in the trade pact notably vietnam and japan made significant concessions to american negotiators because they felt threatened by china’s rise now the presidential candidates are lumping them together with china holding them responsible for killing american jobs with few exceptions chinese officials have tried to steer clear of commenting on the american candidates even chinese academics the usual pipeline to beijing’s thinking have been wary of doing so to avoid being accused of violating china’s policy of not interfering publicly in other countries’ politics to the extent that chinese experts say anything it is to express hope that this year’s talk of getting tough on trade will not be a harbinger of policy shifts ahead “there is no big difference from previous presidential campaigns only more emphasis due to the poor world trade performances” and weak global economic prospects said he weiwen a   of the   s  u study center at the china association of international trade in beijing the uncertainty for china and much of asia is whether the candidates will sing the same trade tunes once in office mr trump’s confrontational approach would seem to indicate some   mrs clinton seems less likely to change american policies given that she supported president obama’s free trade efforts during his first term of office when she was secretary of state former presidents bill clinton and george w bush and mr obama at least initially all tried to help china become more involved in the world economy they hoped that more enmeshed trade and financial relationships would mean a more democratic china with closer diplomatic ties to the west it seemed to work for a while but in the last three years china under president xi jinping has shifted toward more authoritarian rule china has embarked on a   military buildup constructed artificial islands with   runways in the south china sea and challenged japan’s control of a cluster of islands north of taiwan and a combination of strict censorship and comprehensive propaganda has fanned the already strong nationalism of the chinese public those geopolitics have left american policy makers with two choices neither of them appetizing further trade with china and additional investments there by western multinationals could strengthen the chinese economy and help beijing afford even more ambitious territorial and military policies discouraging trade and investment could cause lower economic growth that might slow china’s military rise but also might feed   sentiment and foster public demands for more assertive foreign policy if the candidates’ ideas became policy china would almost certainly retaliate in some fashion american exports while sharply smaller than those china sends in the other direction are a potential focus beijing has proved especially adept in the past at targeting american exports from swing states in presidential elections and closely fought congressional districts maximizing its leverage in the political process even if the economic effects were limited the biggest immediate casualty of tougher trade policies could be the obama administration’s effort to strengthen relations with countries like japan singapore and vietnam as a way to balance china’s growing muscle in east asia the economic centerpiece of the administration’s   pivot to asia has been the negotiation of the   partnership that agreement calls for dismantling barriers to american trade with many of the countries that find themselves increasingly uneasy about china’s growing dominance mr trump denounced the pact again on tuesday saying that it would force american workers to compete with   vietnamese workers mrs clinton after supporting the early negotiations as secretary of state has come out against the pact since the fall saying that the deal does not go far enough to address issues like currency manipulation yet canceling the trade pact could actually cause more problems by pushing american allies in the region into china’s arms and preventing american companies from developing in emerging asian markets “if america kills the t p p ” said kishore mahbubani the dean of the lee kuan yew school of public policy in singapore “then china becomes the main center of economic gravity ”',\n",

campaign and congressional democrats lashed out at comey for the timing of the letter at a campaign rally in daytona beach florida clinton said comey’s action is “not just strange it’s unprecedented” she also tweeted that “fbi director comey bowed to partisan pressure” suggesting that the letter was an effort to appease congressional republican leaders opposed to comey’s determination last july that there was no basis for criminal charges against clinton over her use of a private email server democratic senate minority leader harry reid sent a letter to comey suggesting that he had violated the law forbidding government employees to use their official positions to influence the result of an election “i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act” he wrote “through your partisan actions you may have broken the law” he added that comey had “demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another” because he had made public the renewed fbi interest in clinton’s emails but was silent on what reid called “explosive information” supposedly connecting republican presidential candidate donald trump to russian government officials here reid was resorting to the russiabaiting that has been the clinton campaign’s main response to the publication by wikileaks of tens of thousands of emails and other documents sent or received by campaign chairman john podesta including devastating information on bill clinton’s use of the clinton foundation to obtain lucrative speaking engagements with corporations and business associations campaign spokesmen have refused to discuss the contents of the emails claiming that they were hacked by russian government agents and then handed over to wikileaks to damage clinton and help trump nbc news reported sunday that the fbi has now obtained a search warrant to go through all  emails found on the laptop of former congressman anthony weiner the estranged husband of clinton’s closest aide huma abedin weiner is under fbi investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl the wall street journal gave details in a story posted on its web site sunday afternoon of the explosive internal crisis within the fbi that led to comey’s letter to congress by this account there has been a fierce battle within the fbi and between the fbi and the justice department not only over the clinton email investigation but over separate investigations involving four fbi field offices new york washington dc los angeles and little rock arkansas into the operations of the clinton foundation ag lynch a democrat apparatchik like the rest of the top tier of the democratic party mafia and typical of the black misleaders that ice african american radicalism in a conflicted age more than eight months ago fbi agents presented plans for a more aggressive investigation of the foundation to career prosecutors in the justice department only to have the proposal blocked on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence the fbi offices nonetheless continued their investigations which were intensified after the clinton email investigation was wound up in july the journal report suggests that either a substantial faction within the fbi was convinced that top fbi officials were covering up criminal activities on the part of hillary and bill clinton or the fbi dissidents were politically motivated to use agency resources to undermine hillary clinton’s presidential campaign or both when top officials in the fbi and justice department opposed these efforts open rebellion followed expressed in leaks to the wall street journal centrally targeting fbi deputy director andrew mccabe whose wife was an unsuccessful democratic candidate for state senate in virginia last year according to some press reports comey sent his letter to congress last week because he was convinced the information would become public anyway through further leaks by fbi subordinates the open warfare engulfing washington on the eve of a presidential election reveals that the entire political system and the state apparatus itself are riven by tensions and conflicts so deep and bitter that they cannot be contained within the traditional framework of bourgeois elections fueling these tensions is the convergence of crises on the economic geopolitical internal political and social fronts the us and world economy remain mired in stagnation more than eight years after the  wall street crash and there are growing fears that central bank policies designed to buttress the banks and drive up stock prices are leading to a new financial disaster the economic crisis is fueling social anger and alienation from the entire political system as reflected in different ways in the mass support for the antiwall street campaign of the selfstyled “socialist” bernie sanders and the “america first” pseudopopulist campaign of donald trump twentyfive years of unending war and fifteen years of the “war on terror” have failed to secure us hegemony in the middle east and only heightened fears within the ruling elite that us imperialism is losing ground to rivals such as russia and china the disarray of us policy in syria in particular has led to bitter conflicts and recriminations over us policy and demands for a major escalation of military violence not only in syria but throughout the middle east these are combined with calls for a more aggressive confrontation with russia and china the great danger is that these conflicts are being fought out behind the backs of the working class by different factions of the same reactionary ruling class unless the working class intervenes as an independent political and revolutionary force fighting for its own interests in opposition to all parties and factions of the capitalist class the crisis will inevitably result in ever more rightwing policies at home and ever wider wars abroad leading inexorably to a new world war the capitalist twoparty system offers only two reactionary alternatives the fascistic billionaire trump who demands a vast increase in military spending and authoritarian methods of rule and the multimillionaire clinton the favorite of wall street and the militaryintelligence apparatus who would continue and escalate the rightwing policies of the obama administration all factions of the ruling elite agree on concealing the implications of the world capitalist crisis from working people hence the degraded character of the bourgeois election campaign with any serious discussion of the social crisis and the war danger drowned out by media sensationalism over a succession of sex scandals and antirussian propaganda the socialist equality party entered the  elections to prepare the working class for the political convulsions that have already begun even before the ballots are counted on election day our candidates jerry white for president and niles niemuth for vice president have consistently warned that the capitalist campaigns are aimed at concealing the crisis and disarming working people the sep election campaign is not fundamentally about votes but about building a political leadership in the working class for the great struggles to come —patrick martin and barry grey the fbi intervenes in the  election \\ndateline  october  \\ni n an extraordinary and unprecedented action the federal bureau of investigation has stepped into the  presidential campaign only  days before election day sending a letter to congress announcing new “investigative steps” related to hillary clinton’s use of a private email server \\nthe threeparagraph letter by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees on friday is remarkably vague it states that “in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation” of clinton’s personal email server which comey notes he had previously told congress was “completed” \\nhe states that he has agreed to “allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation” he acknowledges that the fbi “cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant” \\nthe obvious question that arises is why given the fact that the fbi has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the clinton email case the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal fbi ban on making politically sensitive announcements within  days of a us election \\nfollowing the report of comey’s letter the news media citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by clinton aide huma abedin and her husband former representative anthony weiner \\nweiner is under fbi investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl abedin announced her separation from weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving weiner and sexually explicit internet activity became public \\ncomey’s letter was hailed by donald trump and republican party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the fbi investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by comey in july that no charges would be brought against the democratic presidential candidate \\nclinton spoke to the press briefly friday evening demanding that the fbi provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server she pointed out that more than  million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues in response to questions she indicated that the fbi has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media \\nit is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind comey’s letter and the political forces for which he is speaking however his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility \\nthis direct intervention into the election by the top policeintelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the american ruling class and the state the election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and antiestablishment sentiment yet it has ended in a contest between two rightwing representatives of the richest  percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate \\nit has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates—the fascistic billionaire trump seeking to channel discontent along the most rightwing chauvinist and racist channels the multimillionaire clinton relying on sex scandals and a mccarthyite attack on trump as an agent of russian president vladimir putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nucleararmed russia \\nthe entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system it has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis mounting international tensions and worsening crises for us imperialism around the world ie the ongoing debacle of washington’s war for regime change in syria the signs of disarray in the antichinese “pivot to asia” the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist “allies” in europe particularly germany \\nthe convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the american ruling class over policy questions magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home \\nwhether the intention of comey’s letter was to inflict fatal damage to clinton’s candidacy shore up endangered republican majorities in the senate and house or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming clinton administration it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes officeif gte mso

justice department official suggested that comey was under intense pressure from within the fbi over his previous declaration that no competent prosecutor would bring charges against clinton over her use of the private server if true this means that sections of the federal police agency are in open revolt against the candidate who may shortly become their nominal “commanderinchief” \\nthe fbi intervention on the eve of the  election represents an acceleration of a trend in us politics that first came to the surface in the series of republicanled investigations into the bill clinton administration culminating in his impeachment in  this was followed by the stolen election of  when the supreme court intervened and by a  majority halted the recounting of ballots in florida in order to award the white house to george w bush the loser in the popular vote \\nthe twoparty system in the united states has always been an instrument of class rule dominated by corporate america the unprecedented growth of social inequality over the past four decades has widened the gulf between the political system and the great majority of the population more and more official political life revolves around palace intrigues in which the media and the militaryintelligence apparatus play critical roles the methods of scandalmongering calculated leaks and political stink bombs prevail \\none thing is clear none of these strokes and counterstrokes between rival capitalist factions has anything to do with defending the democratic rights and social interests of working people as far as the capitalist twoparty system is concerned the american people are merely an object of manipulation to be stampeded by demagogy and scandal \\npatrick martin please comment and debate directly on our

but already the exuberance of local fans has collided with athletes’ and officials’ pleas for silence “we are not used to this in table tennis” said galia dvorak of spain who acknowledged that she had been shocked and unnerved by jeers from brazilian fans during her match she added “it was just weird ” at the olympic aquatics stadium an official twice requested silence from the crowd before a

court fans whistled and jeered when a canadian team served the   announcer asked them to cheer for everyone during a men’s fencing event raucous brazilian fans tossed aside the sport’s typically convoluted rules of decorum  —   cheering is all right but only at certain moments  —   as they shook the stands with continuous spasms of celebration and booed anyone who notched a point against one of their own “it’s an incredible feeling when you enter this arena” the brazilian fencer ghislain perrier said after losing his bout “you feel all the power of the brazilian people ” the fans’ presence has been most striking though at the table tennis arena outside a select few countries the sport struggles to draw fans and generate excitement players in the sport value silence which allows them to hear the way the ball bounces off an opponent’s paddle and to react more smoothly to a shot the tenor of the match on sunday night between hugo calderano of brazil and tang peng of hong kong revealed itself before a single point was played calderano  entered the arena like a gladiator hearing his name bellowed in unison from the stands and when tang  hit a   shot into the net the crowd

subtle sport often likened to chess  —   these were vividly unusual scenes but such displays had been going on at the olympic table tennis pavilion all weekend “it’s usually a more serious sport”

step away from the table that made the fans boo louder they stopped only to sing to calderano “vou te apoiar hugo” “i will support you hugo ” on saturday afternoon while caroline kumahara of são paulo

this is normal for them ” it has been highly abnormal for the players though on saturday morning gui lin the other woman representing brazil in singles stepped away from the table at one point to motion to the stands to quiet her vocal fans  —   a rather extraordinary move in the wider context of sports gui who said she appreciated the cheers nevertheless seemed uneasy afterward as she described table tennis as a sport “where you have to be quiet” and the noise as a sign of disrespect “they have to focus” gui said of her opponents “and there are three other tables playing and i thought it wasn’t right to disturb the others because of me ” gui’s opponent dvorak blamed the crowd’s jeers for her   loss in the first game “like in other countries like in china they cheer a lot

additional energy “we are used to having events only with people who already know our sport ” not all   were peeved tommy danielsson the luxembourg coach said “i find it very nice when the audience gets involved we need this people can see that this is not just a hobby game you play in a garage at home ” the atmosphere sunday supported that assertion the crowd grew more engrossed and more

       " 'among this group of gop primary voters trump is the porsche of candidates if donald trump were a car he would be a porsche if he were an animal he’d be a lion and people like porsches and lions\\n\\nor at least “walmart moms” do according to a focus group of republican primaryvoting walmart moms conducted this past week in pittsburgh by democratic pollster margie omero and republican pollster neil newhouse walmart moms are defined as women who have children younger than  at home and have gone to the store at least once in the past month the focus groups — the two pollsters did another one with swing moms in suburban philadelphia — were funded by walmart\\n\\n“characterizing donald trump as a type of car or animal resulted in some fascinating descriptions — from the gop group women depicted him as a porsche a ferrari a muscle car a boxer who stands his ground a bulldog an escalade a lion fierce and king of the jungle and as an unpredictable cat” newhouse and omero wrote in a memo summarizing the results “these moms praised him as someone who speaks his mind stands his ground and is refreshingly politically incorrect”\\n\\nthe most baffling moments from donald trump’s washington post ed board interview\\n\\nthe focus group which was split evenly between trump supporters and those backing another republican candidate provides a fascinating window into not only how pennsylvanians view trump on the eve of the state’s primary on tuesday but also into how the real estate mogul is viewed more broadly\\n\\nthe findings should be comforting for trump and deeply concerning not only for sen ted cruz of texas and ohio gov john kasich his rivals for the republican nomination but also for the “never trump” movement within the gop establishment\\n\\n“these gop walmart moms seem to want no part of the nevertrump movement” newhouse told me sunday “in fact they respect his strength and his straight talk and believe he is the party’s best shot to beat hillary”\\n\\nmost importantly the gop primary race as seen through the lens of these walmart moms is effectively trump vs everyone else neither cruz nor kasich make much of an impression with these women — even this late in the primary process\\n\\n“voters were generally unable to tell us much about either cruz or kasich republican primary voters seemed to dislike cruz perhaps more than the swing moms he was generally described in both groups as ‘religious’ ‘gorilla — almost human’ or ‘like a neighbor’s dog — you don’t know if they’re going to bite’\\u2009” omero and newhouse wrote “kasich’s image was even thinner ‘i think they like him in ohio’ said one ‘too sane’ or ‘mild like a kitten’ said others”\\n\\nthen there’s the fact that for all the attention paid to trump’s comments about women during his long life in the public eye the vast majority of these gop walmart moms seems strikingly unbothered by his views on women\\n\\n“when these gop moms were pushed about trump’s gender issues there was some acknowledgment that he may be a ‘sexist’ but general agreement among these women was that ‘i don’t really care i’ve seen worse’\\xa0” newhouse and omero wrote\\n\\nthat’s an absolutely stunning finding — at least to me\\n\\nthe new donald trump should scare the hell out of the gop establishment\\n\\nwhen it comes to the broader delegate fight the women in the focus group think trump is also in very good shape and think it would be deeply unfair for the person who enters the convention with the most votes and delegates not to be chosen as the republican nominee\\n\\n“i’d feel terribly misled” one woman said when asked about the prospect “cheated” another said not surprisingly this group was equally dismissive about the prospect of house speaker paul d ryan or some other “white knight” candidate riding to the rescue at the convention “if convention turned to someone like paul ryan — shows that gop leaders don’t really care about them” newhouse tweeted while conducting the focus group\\n\\nfinally there’s a very strong sense that trump represents the gop’s best chance of beating democratic frontrunner hillary clinton in the fall — despite lots and lots of polling that suggests he would be a decidedly weak nominee against the former secretary of state\\n\\nthe walmart moms said they would feel “relieved” “concerned” “good” and “optimistic” with trump as the nominee — a remarkable set of emotions toward the business mogul “there was no hesitation among the gop women that trump could beat clinton and that they would support the gop nominee — even if he hadn’t been their first choice” newhouse and omero wrote\\n\\nwith trump coming off a huge win in new york last tuesday and almost certainly headed to a fivestate sweep this tuesday these findings suggest that among the gop rank and file he is considered far more likely to be the republican nominee than is commonly understood in washington — a frightening prospect for party leaders who believe that nominating trump could be a massive electoral disaster for their side\\n\\n“pittsburgh’s not that far from washington dc but these gop walmart moms are a world apart from dc in their views on this race” newhouse said “we’ve long passed valentine’s day but among these women it’s coming up all roses for donald trump”',\n",

chilly november day in  a newlycreated coalition of which i was a cofounder marched on the white house to denounce and renounce barack obama as a tool of white supremacy and the imperial war machine “obama obama you can’t hide – we charge you with genocide” we shouted indicting the first black president for the crimes he was busily committing in service to his masters on wall street the black is back coalition for social justice peace and reparations had been formed less than two months before largely to demonstrate that not all black people were bamboozled by the slick corporate politician from chicago elected one year earlier in the nation’s first billion dollar presidential campaign as the coalition’s founding press release stated  \\n“black and brown people continue to suffer the brunt of ununderemployment and predatory loan scandal crises military spending under obama has increased as have the warfare this nation continues to export to iraq afghanistan pakistan venezuela and colombia mass incarceration police brutality and political imprisonment remain rampant” \\nthe black is back coalition warned of the “traps set by obama’s socalled ‘postracial’ politics that perpetuates the same oppressive militarist agenda well known during the bush regime” \\nto paraphrase fidel castro history has vindicated us \\n“obama joined george bush and bill clinton in perpetuating the  yearlong slaughter in the democratic republic of congo that has claimed more than six million lives” \\nobama mobilized nato air forces and jihadist proxies to destroy libya which had previously enjoyed the highest living standard in africa he redeployed these same al qaida terrorists to syria killing  people displacing half the surviving population and bringing the us to the very brink of nuclear war with russia this socalled “son of africa” has effectively occupied most of the continent through a us military command africom that was less than a year old when obama was sworn into office the african union provides diplomatic cover for the ciarun “peace keeping” mission in somalia while us conventional forces have infiltrated the militaries of all but two african nations the holdouts eritrea and zimbabwe are under constant threat of regime change obama joined george bush and bill clinton in perpetuating the  yearlong slaughter in the democratic republic of congo that has claimed more than six million lives the worst genocide since world war two “obama obama you can’t hide we charge you with genocide” \\nwith the eager assistance of secretary of state hillary clinton obama baldly abetted a nazispearheaded coup against the elected government in ukraine  and then blamed moscow when russianspeaking ukrainians resisted provoking a “new cold war” that could turn hot in an instant at the same time obama “pivoted” to militarily confront china whose economy is already by some measures larger than the us the jihadist war in syria should also be seen as a theater of imperialism’s last ditch offensive to encircle “eurasia” in hopes of preserving usbased multinational corporate domination of a “rigged” system of dollarbased world trade \\njust as the black is back coalition warned barack obama was the black face of imperialism  a change of color without a difference he tried to hand off the controls to hillary clinton who got six million votes less than he did and lost \\nback in  when obama and clinton were pretending to be ideological opponents  as cookiecutter corporate democrats often do  we at black agenda report wrote that “ there’s not a dime’s worth of difference ” between the two every decent peaceloving person on earth should be glad to be rid of both of them humanity would probably not survive another year of either one \\n“barack obama was the black face of imperialism  a change of color without a difference” \\ndonald trump is also a danger to humanity like every other us chief executive since truman nuked hiroshima and nagasaki if words mean anything trump starts off posing less of a doomsday international menace since he claims to want to establish talking rather than shouting threatening nukerattling relations with russia and china while clinton’s version of “reset” was an armed confrontation with russia over the skies of syria of course all that could quickly change trump may be a “party of one” among republicans in congress and even in his own cabinet \\nfor those who fear trump’s “fascism” the threat level depends on how he uses the arsenal of repressive tools bequeathed to him by the obama administration these legal infrastructural and technological instruments of the national security state are fascist in their intent they were made for the purpose of tracking disorganizing neutralizing and locking up dissidents and disinforming the public at large thus president obama and his predecessors were fascist minded  whether you call their administrations operatively fascist or not the obama administration would not have pushed a bill through congress allowing the us military to detain american citizens without trial or charge if he had not anticipating using it he would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule fascistminded is all that can be said of trump at this point as well \\nblack lives matter activists have been under fbi surveillance since day one ever since ferguson the federal government has taken the lead in overcharging “rioters” in rebellious cities new york city cops have used social media surveillance as the basis for conspiracy charges against groups of more than  young black people in separate sweeps in manhattan and the bronx the “fascism” that correctly described jim crow rule in the precivil rights south lives on at the core of the mass black incarceration regime put in place with the crushing of the black liberation movement two generations ago the current movement against police terror which ultimately demands black community control of the police put activists in direct confrontation with the coercive arm of the state there is no retreat from this response to the demands of black people “on the street” who bear the daily brunt of repression and are also among the most effective organizers \\n“obama would not have feverishly upgraded an omnipresent national and global surveillance apparatus if he did not anticipate putting it to the task of martial rule” \\nthe black movement against police terror didn’t need a donald trump waiting in the vestibule of the white house to get “mad” the movement has already crossed the rubicon of confrontation with the state the moment occurred in the second term of the first black president when a new generation learned that liberation cannot be vicariously experienced the  st century black movement emerged with the knowledge that black corporate democrats are not their allies nor are black police chiefs or black preachers whose real loyalties are to the democratic party and its wall street patrons \\nif the black movement were afraid of the likes of donald trump it never would have gone up against the militarized police that occupy black communities you can’t scare people with a specter if they have already been in combat with the real thing \\nto the extent that electoral activity is useful to the movement it should be employed with special vigilance close at hand against misleaders like the  members of the congressional black caucus who failed to support the grayson amendment that would have halted pentagon transfers of weapons and equipment to local police departments these “ treasonous  ” comprising  percent of fullvoting black democrats in the house cast their shameful votes in june  just two months before michael brown was shot down in ferguson missouri rep william “lacy” clay representing michael brown’s district was among the  if the movement is to have any special targets for electoral vengeance it is these homegrown enemies who turn black people’s votes against themselves \\ntrump or no trump the black movement must continue to press and refine its demands  or power will concede nothing on november  after their annual march on the white house the organizations of the black is back coalition ratified a point document that puts selfdetermination at the heart of the broadest range of issues confronting black america “every central demand every strategy of struggle must be formulated with the goal of selfdetermination in mind otherwise the movement will allow itself to be drowned in reformist schemes and projects that bind black people even more tightly to structures of outside control” the points range from “black community control of police” to “halting gentrification” to “nationalization of the banks” \\nthe points were compiled during barack obama’s time in the white house and they will

       " ' takeaways from the republican debate cnn republicans began their debate thursday night with insults and ended with three candidates pledging to back donald trump should he win the nomination\\n\\nflorida sen marco rubio and texas sen ted cruz took more shots at trump in fox news debate  and through it all the billionaire businessman seemed to relish standing center stage defending himself against foes and moderators while showing his mettle to supporters\\n\\nall three were happy to deflect efforts to drag them into sustained policy discussions and kept things personal ohio gov john kasich was content to stand to the side and watch it all\\n\\nhere are seven takeaways from thursdays republican debate\\n\\nminutes into the debate trump was boasting about the size of his penis\\n\\nclearly annoyed that rubio had joked days ago about the size of trumps hands  suggesting as trump put it that if theyre small something else might be small  the republican frontrunner made a claim seldom heard during a presidential debate\\n\\ni guarantee you theres no problem i guarantee you he said\\n\\nit was a pg start to a twohour food fight that parents wouldnt have wanted their kids to watch\\n\\nearly on as rubio pressed trump for more policy details the two gave each other nicknames dont worry about it little marco trump said to which rubio responded lets hear it big donald\\n\\ntrump said florida wouldnt elect rubio dogcatcher after all of his missed senate votes cruz gave trump instructions on letting go of his anger donald learn not to interrupt its not complicated count to  donald count to  count to \\n\\nlater when cruz told trump to breathe rubio jumped in and joked that the two were doing yoga\\n\\ni really hope that we dont see yoga on this stage cruz answered\\n\\nand then rubio pointed to trump whod just admitted his flexibility on policies and said well hes very flexible so you never know\\n\\nit seemed as if fox news had grown tired of trumps opponents inability to knock him down  so the moderators decided to do it themselves\\n\\nchris wallace had a realtime fact check queued up when trump asserted hed cut  billion in spending  pointing out that his strategies eliminating the department of education and the environmental protection agency which trump called the department of environmental protection would save just a fraction of that amount\\n\\nit forced an awkward and unspecific claim about other things out of trump\\n\\nim not only talking about drugs im talking about other things he said well save more than  billion a year if we negotiate we dont negotiate\\n\\nmegyn kelly took her shot later on setting up three clips of trump taking one policy position and then days later taking the opposite position\\n\\ntrump was unmoored insisting he had logical explanations about his reversals on syrian refugees the war in afghanistan and more  and that by the way it doesnt matter much anyway\\n\\nyou have to have a certain degree of flexibility he said\\n\\nted cruz needs trumps momentum to ebb as much as anyone but he didnt spend much of the night on the attack for the most part cruz stood aside and watched rubio and trump rip each other to shreds and then turned to the audience and threw up his hands\\n\\nmegyn let me just ask the voters at home is this the debate you want playing out in the general election he said\\n\\ncruz took his shots at trump too but he let rubio do the dirty work  betting that he rather than the florida senator will reap the benefits\\n\\nrubio for instance built on the attack line mitt romney started earlier in the day regarding trump university pressing trump over and over to admit he was ripping off the people who paid  for his courses at a school thats now the subject of a classaction lawsuit\\n\\ncruz is trying to coopt the angry electorate that trump has tapped into and his pitch is simple trump is the villain youve been mad at\\n\\nfor  years donald has been part of the corruption in washington that youre angry about he said\\n\\nits entirely possible that the debate did nothing to change cruzs fortunes but he does have a big opportunity on the horizon\\n\\nof the four states to only allow republicans to vote in gop nominating contests cruz has won three thanks to his strength among conservatives and the rules limiting trumps ability to expand the electorate and all four states set to vote saturday  kansas kentucky louisiana and maine  have closed contests\\n\\nkasich will not under any circumstances engage directly with his foes on the debate stage\\n\\nas the democrats tell me all the time i can get the crossover votes he boasted early in the debate adding that hes often told at town halls that he seems to be the adult on stage\\n\\nive talked about issues i have never tried to go and get into these kinda scrums that were seeing here he said\\n\\nhe demonstrated his experience on economic and budgetary challenges and foreign policy and showed no signs of backing out of the race anytime soon  especially not before ohios march  primary\\n\\nfor rubio thats all a big problem\\n\\nthe man who won the hearts of the republican establishment by confronting trump headon in the last debate was ready to hit the billionaire again and again  but a for super tuesday intervened and some of the shine wore off\\n\\nhe confronted trump once again baiting the business mogul by calling him names attacking his business ventures and accusing him of knowing nothing about policy  even though he struggled with a raspy voice\\n\\non the campaign trail trump has proposed changing us libel laws so that politicians can more easily sue journalists\\n\\nbut on thursday night trump said the bond between reporters and politicians who agree to go offtherecord is too strong to break that he said is why he wont ask the new york times to release a transcript or recording of an offtherecord conversation he had with the newspapers editorial board about immigration\\n\\ni think being off the record is very important i will honor it he said\\n\\nthen trump allowed  as his foes claimed  that he might have softened his hardline stance he has taken on the campaign trail that he will build a wall on the usmexico border and deport  million undocumented immigrants\\n\\ni will say that in immigration as well as with anything else there has to be tug and pull you have to be able to have some flexibility he said i may have said something like that with the new york times but i am not going to release something off the record\\n\\ntrumps opponents pounced on his remark but they could be misreading his support many trump backers say they know he cant achieve everything he proposes but believe hell fight for it more effectively than anyone else\\n\\nin an interview with cnns dana bash afterward he defended that flexibility saying im flexible with everything you cant just say this is it and im never going to talk he said with that being said you have to make great deals\\n\\ncoming less than  hours after mitt romney launched a scathing broadside against trump the candidates answer to the last question of the debate was particularly striking\\n\\nfox news moderators asked rubio cruz and kasich whether theyd back trump if he wins the nomination\\n\\nall three said yes\\n\\nthe moment wont help rubio  who had joined the nevertrump movement of republicans vowing not to support trump on twitter last week  with that crowd\\n\\nmore important though is what they didnt say\\n\\nthe premise of the question was that trump had already won the nomination but there are scenarios in which republicans could have more chances to stop that from happening even after all  states vote\\n\\na better question would the republican field support the candidate who wins the most delegates\\n\\nso what does this change\\n\\ntrump struggled with policy details butted in when other candidates were speaking and sparred with the moderators\\n\\nso what else is new\\n\\nhis sharp and sharply personal exchanges with his rivals might have been amped up thursday night but still sounded much like trumps first  debates\\n\\nthe frontrunner doesnt get rattled or lose his wit even when he is under attack from everyone else on stage he often seems to relish it  as if his foes criticism gives him an excuse to stop holding back\\n\\nnone of the debates so far have changed the trajectory of the race  in part because trump is the master of the debate postgame finding ways to deflect weak points and suck up media oxygen while branding his foes with nicknames like little marco and lyin ted and claiming victory  no matter what happened',\n",

       " 'is sanders  becoming nader  bernie sanders for all his talk of revolution never wanted to be ralph nader he has a long history of keeping the democratic party at arm’s length but he also has a long history of rejecting spoiler bids since  he has always endorsed the democratic presidential nominee snubbing nader’s four leftwing thirdparty campaigns he became a democrat to run for president instead of keeping his “i” and following in nader’s footsteps he has pledged to support hillary clinton if she wins the democratic nomination and has ripped donald trump at every opportunity\\n\\nbut even if sanders isn’t deliberately trying to replicate the electoral trauma inflicted by nader in —when he probably cost al gore the presidency—bernie’s lingering presence in the democratic primary threatens to produce a similar result in november delegitimizing the eventual democratic nominee in the eyes of the left and sending many critics if not to trump then to the green party’s jill stein or the libertarian party’s gary johnson\\n\\nin the first poll to assess the impact of thirdparty candidates public policy polling found last week that the inclusion of stein and johnson shaves  percentage points off clinton’s lead over trump conversely the minor party duo loses a combined  points when sanders is tested as the democratic nominee indicating that sanders’ voters account for clinton’s reduced standing\\n\\na couple points a couple million voters is no big deal to clinton if she’s trouncing trump but if he makes it a race democrats may find their political posttraumatic stress disorder from  flaring up\\n\\nand while clinton would be the most enraged if she suffers gore’s fate it is not in sanders’ interest to join nader on the democratic party’s unofficial wall of shame his ultimate goal is to remake the party in his progressive populist image he can’t do that if his name is uttered by rankandfile democrats only when seething\\n\\nthat means sanders has to strategize very carefully as he prepares to leave his mark at the convention how can he bend the party to his will without breaking it\\n\\none way would be to follow the lead of jesse jackson in  who remained in the race for the entire primary but when he came to the democratic convention with  percent of the pledged delegates he went to great lengths to keep his team focused on changing the party over the long haul rather than disrupting the election though michael dukakis still lost “i’m going to ask you to do a hard thing” jackson said to his delegates “put your focus on why were here if youre following my lead then reflect my spirit attitude and discipline we dont have the time to fill up the media airwaves with pollution”\\n\\na runnerup staying in until the last presidential primary vote is counted by itself has never been tantamount to a fatal party schism clinton’s reluctance in the spring of  to accept the delegate math did not prevent barack obama from becoming the first democrat to break  percent of the popular vote since lyndon b johnson jerry brown’s refusal to endorse his  rival bill clinton proved to be about as damaging as a spitball in the spring of  brown and sen frank church entered the presidential race—and won several late contests—in a futile attempt to stop jimmy carter from winning the white house\\n\\njackson didn’t quit before it was officially over for the same reason sanders won’t more delegates means more influence at the convention but that’s where sanders faces a paradox the potential of using his delegates to make her convention disorderly—forcing floor fights over platform language nominating himself on the floor withholding his endorsement—is what gives him leverage but to unleash convention chaos risks a repeat of  when efforts by eugene mccarthy’s delegates to wrest the nomination from hubert humphrey and include an antivietnam war plank to the platform failed on the convention floor prompting a livid mccarthy to leave the convention without endorsing the ticket he gave an extremely reluctant endorsement in the campaign’s final days and his unwillingness to rally his supporters possibly tipped five states to the republican winner richard nixon\\n\\nit seems unlikely that sanders would renege on his pledge to back the eventual nominee but a passiveaggressive “nondorsement”—just keeping quiet—or a feeble campaign trail schedule could still stir hostile feelings among his supporters that the party establishment treated their campaign unfairly and views their revolution with disdain\\n\\nhow might sanders walk the fine line he needs to—pushing hard for his ideal platform without poisoning the party well\\n\\nperhaps the most potent move he could make without sacrificing his policy agenda would be to declare after the last ballot is cast in the district of columbia on june  that hillary clinton won the majority of the pledged delegates “fair and square”\\n\\na faction of sanders supporters continues to circulate notions that the game has been rigged either by the rules— unelected superdelegates and primaries closed to independents—or by outright cheating with the long lines to vote in arizona and berniefriendly early exit poll data looming large in online conspiracy theories sanders has not done much to promulgate the conspiracies but neither has he tried hard to shut them down he does regularly complain about superdelegates and closed primaries despite the fact that he lost  of the  primaries so far in which independents could vote and that the distribution of superdelegates on the basis of the popular vote would not give him the overall delegate lead\\n\\nin other words he didn’t lose because of the rules but if his supporters are left with the impression that rules were designed by the party to thwart their ambitions then they will have little hesitation to bolt the party\\n\\nsanders could ditch his strident antiestablishment tone and help disabuse his supporters of their suspicions closing the electoral chapter of the campaign with a speech along the lines of “our campaign performed exponentially better than anyone predicted we worked together to raise enough money to be heard and our message was heard we fought for more debates we got them and we engaged in a substantive dialogue of ideas we should take enormous pride in winning probably by then more than  states and  percent of the pledged delegates while we also tip our hat to hillary clinton for winning a little more our party’s commitment to democracy gave us a fair shot and the proof is in how well we did in the face of the long odds”\\n\\ndeclaring the process to be on the level would effectively table a floor fight over the primary process rules that some sanders allies have been hankering for and keep the convention spotlight on what sanders ran to accomplish in the first place to popularize policy proposals that would break up the banks provide free college extend medicare for all and eliminate corporate campaign cash\\n\\nan additional subtext of such a message would be to assure his supporters “the democratic party is our home” countering the message being sold by the thirdparty candidates that it is impossible for sandernistas to advance their revolution within the confines of the democratic party\\n\\nin  jesse jackson faced a similar challenge in keeping his restless supporters in the party fold while also pressing the dukakis camp for substantive concessions\\n\\nso he took a highly calibrated approach to the party he negotiated with dukakis’ aides a platform that reflected much of his liberal agenda though scrubbed of elements deemed too controversial three planks left out were brought to the floor for debate but jackson did not force a floor vote on the most divisive of the three “selfdetermination” for palestinians\\n\\nthe moral victory of exercising influence over the platform may have looked ephemeral in the years that followed the defeat of dukakis was blamed on excessive liberalism leading to the  nomination of bill clinton who took the party in a moderate direction but jackson in  enthused at how much he was able to influence the white house in the clinton years as well as catapult his top staffers into the democratic party apparatus and had he not kept his supporters inside the democratic tent neither clinton’s presidency nor obama’s more liberal administration would have been possible\\n\\nsanders never endorsed nader but he did endorse jackson in  if he wants his  campaign to leave a lasting legacy on the

to decide whether to reinstate us sanctions he warned that if “we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies then the agreement will be terminated” trump’s actions appeared to leave the united states relatively isolated on the world stage his hawkish new stance toward iran including steps against the islamic revolutionary guard corps received strong backing only from

decision to decertify the deal will isolate the united states as other signatories of the accord remained committed to it rouhani said in a live television address the deal was not renegotiable he

senior vice president and head of global business at spin master a canadian toy company that also sells etch a sketch among many other products “they don’t know what’s inside and they get excited

on waiting lists and even buying lottery tickets for the toy sellers on amazon and ebay were asking more than three times the retail price on friday hatchimals arrive inside a colorful spotted egg they come in five species  —   draggles and pengualas which look like penguins owlicorns owls with a unicorn horn and burtles and bearakeets which look like little turtles and bears rub tap and warm the egg and it will coo light up and tap back at you for about half an hour as it eventually gurgles hiccups and slowly pecks its way through the hard shell a video review showing the hatching and growth of a draggle has more than   million views though spin master is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining hatchimals from factories in china the company has not said how many more will be available throughout december and the shortage is expected to continue a new batch of hatchimals will not be available until early in  spin master worked to generate buzz for hatchimals with a secretive launch and managed to keep all images off the internet until the toy officially “hatched” on oct  which it called “global hatchimals day ” company executives also planned for what they thought would be the right amount of product supply to meet the holiday demand the company declined to release sales figures “by all analyses we thought we had enough” mr martin said “we had no idea that it would be this big it’s been exciting but it’s also been daunting as we try to catch up and fill that demand ” the toy is finding an audience in both boys and girls ranging in age from  to  years old  —   which is a larger demographic than the company expected “nobody knows why these things happen they’re an act of god” said richard gottlieb chief executive of global toy experts and publisher of global toy news while the product may be clever said mr gottlieb “it’s all about a moment in time and it’s hard to predict what makes a product connect ” mandy nigbur a stockbroker in riverton utah knew it wasn’t going to be easy to find a hatchimal when her    daughter requested one from santa so when santa claus made an appearance at her family party over thanksgiving weekend he “knew to tell her his elves weren’t making very many and they might be hard to come by” ms nigbur said “but i was on the hunt ” ms nigbur and three of her friends took to the internet and found a website that alerts customers to what’s in stock at retailers near them they learned that their local target was supposed to get a small shipment of hatchimals on friday so the women arrived at target at  a m and waited outside in the   cold their efforts paid off they each purchased a hatchimal which target sold for the suggested retail price  —   and quickly sold out of “i haven’t decided if mommy gets to be the star or if santa will be the one who gets to bring it to her” said ms nigbur who said she may be more excited about nabbing the product than her daughter will be to receive it the

       " 'cold war jitters resurface as us marines arrive in norway  the new york times for norwegians the sight of dozens of american marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues  —   the first time foreign forces have been posted to their country’s territory since world war ii  —   may have brought a welcomed sense of security but it also harked back to a dark era of the cold war that many had hoped to forget a united states military plane on monday delivered most of the  marines to a garrison in vaernes in central norway a deployment that norwegian officials said had been carried out by the united states as part of a bilateral agreement it was the latest effort by the united states and its european allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent russia which condemned the move despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum the arrival of the marines from camp lejeune n c  —   shown on norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow  —   also provoked some jitters in norway a wealthy   country that is a member of nato but not the european union the nordic state has long prided itself on its independence but the deployment recalled a cold war era in which russian intrigue grabbed headlines and norwegians lived in fear of soviet hegemony neuroses about russia continue to exert influence in norwegian popular culture the political television thriller “okkupert” depicts a future in which norway is occupied by russia and with the backing of the european union takes over the country’s oil production such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about russian espionage and military intervention in october  an unidentified vessel spotted off the stockholm archipelago spurred sweden’s largest mobilization since the cold war and accusations that russia was spying on the country the episode called “the hunt for reds in october” in the swedish news media included unsubstantiated reports of a man in black spotted wading near the vessel it deeply unsettled the nation even as the kremlin issued strenuous denials and accused stockholm of scaremongering then in april  the sudden appearance of an underwater vessel in finland which shares a long border with russia prompted the navy to fire depth charges  —   the first such warning in more than  years and lithuania on monday said it plans to use european union funding to build a fence on the border with russia’s highly militarised kaliningrad exclave to increase security and prevent smuggling according to agence   construction of the    million fence will start this spring and will be finished by the end of the year said interior minister eimutis misiunas “the reasons are both economic to prevent smuggling and geopolitical to strengthen the e u’s external border” mr misiunas said “it would not stop tanks but it will be difficult to climb over ” in moscow the deployment of united states marines in norway has been met with disdain after plans for the deployment were confirmed in october frants klintsevich a deputy chairman of russia’s defense and security committee in the upper chamber of parliament was quoted by russian news media as saying that the kremlin viewed the marines as a direct military threat he also said the deployment made norway a potential target for moscow’s powerful arsenal which includes nuclear weapons on monday the russian authorities reiterated their discontent maria zakharova a spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry said in an interview with nrk the norwegian public broadcaster that the move “certainly will not improve relations ” “the relationship between norway and russia is put to a test now” she said “instead of developing economic cooperation norway is choosing to deploy united states troops on norwegian soil ” the deployment of the marines who will be stationed hundreds of miles from the border with russia comes as countries across europe have been reinforcing their defenses out of concern over an increasingly assertive russia last week a convoy from an american armored brigade crossed the german border into poland the first installment of what are expected to be several thousand nato troops to be based across eastern europe relations between the west and russia in the nordic region and beyond have been tense since that country’s annexation of crimea in march  and the outbreak of conflict between government forces and   rebels in eastern ukraine at the same time   donald j trump fanned alarm in europe in the months leading to his election victory when he questioned whether the united states should automatically defend nato allies if they were attacked and predicated american support on the willingness of countries in the alliance to pay their fair share for military protection in norway some lamented that the marines’ arrival stood against the country’s traditions and threatened to make it a target of its much larger neighbor morten harper a leftist member of the local assembly that governs the area housing the military base said the marines’ arrival was ensnaring norway into the united states’ “power struggle” with russia “we see an ever more tense foreign policy situation” he said “if there ever was to be a major conflict between the great powers in the future this makes us a more likely bomb target ” after world war ii norway abandoned its neutral stance by joining nato in  and committing to the alliance’s doctrine of collective defense but the country which shares a   northern border with russia sought to placate moscow by pledging that no foreign troops would be allowed to be permanently stationed on its soil norway’s defense minister ine eriksen soreide said in an interview on sunday that russia had no reason to be alarmed by the marines’ presence she said that the deployment did not flout the     restriction because the marines were there on a   trial period that was   the marines will take part in military exercises involving skiing and surviving in arctic temperatures to hone their abilities to fight in tough winter conditions it is part of a

       " 'inspired by blasphemy killer new pakistani party eyes  vote lahore pakistan reuters  the head of a new pakistani islamist party that lionizes the killer of a provincial governor said it would take its rallying cry of  death to blasphemers  to next year s general election after its surprisingly strong showing in a recent vote the tehrikelabaik pakistan party which won more than  votes at a weekend byelection was born out of a protest movement supporting mumtaz qadri a bodyguard of the governor of punjab province who gunned down his boss in  over his call to reform strict blasphemy laws supporters of tehreekelabaik waved photos of qadri who became an icon for muslim hardliners after his execution last year at campaign rallies in the eastern city of lahore where it won  percent of the vote in a contest for the seat vacated by ousted former prime minister nawaz sharif  he is a hero  party leader khadim hussain rizvi said when asked about qadri adding that after its thirdplace finish in sunday s byelection it would focus on next year s poll  our preparation starts from today we will contest bravely  while the party has almost no chance of gaining power next year it is part of a new crop of political movements that espouse stricter islamic rule as a remedy to corruption accusations and squabbling among pakistan s three main parties a stronger showing for islamists could give them more influence after the election expected to be hardfought after the supreme court barred sharif from holding office in an interview with reuters rizvi outlined his vision of governance according the barelvi branch of islam of which he is a prominent cleric frequently citing koranic verses and pakistani history he said his party could solve corruption problems  in a day  through stricter adherence to sharia or islamic law  sharia will have to be enforced no one should be worried about it  he said sitting in the upper room of a lahore mosque surrounded by followers many who had adopted qadri s signature look of long hair and kohllined eyes he acknowledged his vision would mean some changes to daily life giving the example of barring women from working as airline flight attendants in its party platform tehrikelabaik pakistan calls for free education free healthcare and social justice but it is best known for its public and passionate support for mumtaz qadri  campaign rallies featured posters with qadri s photo  and its insistence that muslimmajority pakistan s blasphemy laws should remain among the world s harshest dozens of people convicted of blasphemy are currently on death row and at least  pakistanis have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since  according to the center for research and security studies one of the highestprofile killings was of punjab governor taseer who had called for the laws to be reexamined after a minority christian woman was sentenced to death for blasphemy after his arrest over the killing bodyguard qadri drew a slew of admirers among islamists who showered him with rose petal at court hearings tens of thousands thronged his funeral last year to condemn sharif s government for his hanging  tehreekelabaik spokesman ejaz ashrafi said the party started out as the movement to free mumtaz qadri but changed its name and entered politics after his execution  asked about qadri s role as an inspiration to the party leader rizvi said  he is a hero until doomsday he is a hero beyond doomsday  asked if any muslim has the obligation to kill a blasphemer rizvi said  no  there is a law hand him over to that  but qadri he added was justified because pakistani police had failed to charge taseer with blasphemy for criticizing the law tehreekelabaik surprised many by its relatively strong showing in the lahore byelection to fill the parliamentary seat left vacant when the supreme court ousted sharif over unreported income in a case initiated by opposition figure imran khan the seat was won as expected by sharif s wife kulsoom but the ruling pakistan muslim leaguenawaz pmln party s share of the vote in the constituency was cut to  percent from  percent in a  election khan a former cricket star saw his pakistan tehreekeinsaf pti party increase its share to  percent from  percent in the last vote but much of the pmln s margin loss came from votes cast for candidates of new islamist parties in addition to tehreekelabaik a newly declared party linked to hafiz saeed named by the united states and india as the mastermind of the  mumbai attacks that killed  people won about  percent of the lahore vote religious parties have never gained more than a few seats in pakistan s parliament because they tend to appeal to one particular sect or a single issue such as blasphemy still a surge of support for the ultrareligious parties could drain away votes from mainstream groups and potentially give islamists leverage in policymaking tehreekelabaik s rizvi said his only goal was to see a stricter vision of islam enshrined in the law of the land  we want to bring the religion of islam to the throne  he said  ',\n",

trump ms scott said the trump fans in the club responded by calling them “pathetic” and mocked them for creating a “safe space ” at the club fair this month at george washington many of the dozens of   freshman who stopped by the college republicans table expressed relief when ms scott explained that the group had in fact not supported mr trump but tom crean a freshman who joined the club wished

       " 'hillary clinton to portray donald trump’s foreign policy positions as dangerous  the new york times hillary clinton plans to deliver a scorching assessment of donald j trump’s foreign policy prescriptions on thursday casting her likely republican rival as a threat to decades of bipartisan tenets of american diplomacy and declaring him unfit for the presidency mrs clinton’s campaign aides said the speech which she will deliver in san diego would be the start of a persistent assault to portray a potential trump presidency as a dangerous proposition that would weaken american alliances and embolden enemies the argument will include specific criticism of comments mr trump has made about rethinking the united states’s support of nato his proposal to allow japan south korea and saudi arabia to acquire nuclear weapons his vow to temporarily bar muslims from entering the united states and his pledge to advance the use of torture and kill the families of suspected terrorists but mrs clinton will also invoke her experiences as secretary of state including in  when she supported president obama’s decision to send navy seals on a raid in pakistan that killed osama bin laden to make the case that mr trump does not have the temperament to make such decisions “donald trump is unlike any presidential candidate we’ve seen maybe ever certainly in decades in that he does not cross the threshold of fitness for the job” said jake sullivan mrs clinton’s top policy adviser who helped draft the speech mrs clinton will deliver the address on her final campaign swing before california holds its democratic primary on tuesday when she is widely expected to reach the threshold of delegates needed to secure her party’s nomination but in choosing to raise concerns about mr trump’s foreign policy stances she will be speaking to swing voters in general election battleground states who have doubts about a trump presidency while mrs clinton must be cautious not to alienate liberal democrats who oppose some of her hawkish foreign policy stances her campaign says national security could be the catalyst that drives independents and wavering republicans to support her this fall roughly  percent of independent voters and  percent of republican voters said the most important issue this election was terrorism and national security compared with  percent of democrats according to a suffolk   today poll conducted last month at the same time  percent of registered voters said a trump presidency would make america’s image in the world worse according to the latest new york   news poll “there are many republicans concerned about this” r nicholas burns an american ambassador to nato during the george w bush administration who also served on bill clinton’s national security council said of mr trump “they find his policy positions beyond the pale and they’re also turned off by his vulgarity ” to that end the clinton campaign and its outside advisers have embarked on an effort to reach out to prominent moderate republicans who could endorse mrs clinton largely making the case for foreign policy   those calls have included to an aide of the  republican nominee mitt romney and to nicholas f brady who served as secretary of the treasury under mr reagan and the elder mr bush with plans to reach out to james a baker iii a white house chief of staff to president ronald reagan and secretary of state under president george bush in her debates with senator bernie sanders of vermont mrs clinton has defended her foreign policy decisions including urging the obama administration to join a   coalition to oust col muammar   in libya and her  vote to authorize the use of force in iraq which she later said was a mistake in an interview wednesday night mr trump criticized mrs clinton’s early support for the iraq war which he said he opposed and questioned her judgment in libya “bernie sanders said it and i’m going to use it all over the place because it’s true” mr trump said “she is a woman who is   to be president because she has bad judgment ” as each candidate argues the other is unfit to occupy the oval office mrs clinton’s advisers are preparing to make a case against mr trump that will be jarringly different from the sparring of past presidential campaigns over foreign policy “it’s not like the campaign against mccain or romney which was two competing visions” said derek chollet a former white house and pentagon official under president obama instead he said mrs clinton will remind voters that president vladimir v putin of russia and the north korean government of kim   have expressed support for mr trump who has suggested a willingness to talk directly with mr kim a pariah worldwide mrs clinton will also accuse mr trump of bluster and oratory that is in direct opposition to the bipartisan pillars of american diplomacy that every president has adhered to since world war ii julianne smith a former deputy national security adviser to vice president joseph r biden jr pointed to mr trump’s suggestion that the united states rethink its involvement in nato the   coalition of european nations mrs clinton she added needed to explain to voters that “every single president over the last couple decades has understood the value of alliances” and that “playing by the rules makes sense for all of us ” mr trump said mrs clinton was “fraudulent” in her misrepresentation of his foreign policy positions explaining that he supported global alliances but believed that the united states should shoulder less of the financial burden “our country can’t afford to protect the world anymore and at least not get reimbursed for it” he said mrs clinton has delivered a series of foreign policy speeches over the course of the nominating fight that included calling for accelerating the   operation to defeat the islamic state ending the economic embargo against cuba and pledging unwavering support of israel and she had already begun to lay the groundwork against what she called mr trump’s “reckless actions” on foreign policy the san diego speech to be delivered in a city known for its military presence at a time when mr trump is facing scrutiny over his donations to veterans’ groups will present a more sweeping  —   and fearsome  —   portrayal of mr trump one that the clinton campaign will deliver like a drumbeat to voters in the coming months “there’s not a lot of room left in terms of new proposals” mr sullivan said “this is a speech about a vision and principle and purpose not individual policy proposals ” the prospect of a foreign policy debate not centered on policy differences has confounded mrs clinton’s advisers who in a more traditional election would be facing questions about mrs clinton’s call for a   zone with coalition forces to protect syrians or how she would handle the flood of migrants to europe but mr trump in addressing foreign policy has largely relied on gut instinct and appealing to voters’ emotional concerns that america has lost its standing in the world “you do get the sense that he’s in a dialogue with a part of the electorate  —   and i consider it a minority  —   that couldn’t be less interested in facts or realities” said daniel benjamin coordinator for counterterrorism at the state department under mrs clinton “that’s a really challenging task that most of us were unprepared for in many ways ”',\n",

with misery for profit \\nthe opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by world war ii many public servants who had fought against the nazis and their japanese and italian allies had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the un were set up if some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly  using the pretext of the cold war  allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the north atlantic treaty organization  nato  the globalists have controlled and ultimately wall street has financed supranational government instances such as the un imf world bank and a myriad of nongovernmental organization ngo little helpers not only have these done nothing to curtail the manmade disasters of war climate change  slavery and poverty but they have exacerbated them all for the sake of profit  advertisement  license dmca \\nin this orwellian time of moral decay human misery is good for business in a globalization controlled by wall streets puppeteer sociopaths who believe they are the masters of the universe ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor they are not even collateral damage but human lubricant as viewed by the elite one can see that if they are not stopped immediately trade agreements like the transpacific partnership tpp and its transatlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government controlled by a few thousands in complete disregard of not only national interest but also cultural diversity image by john getchel license dmca  advertisement  \\nlook what happened to detroit michigan and countless other manufacturing towns in the united states that are all collateral damage of bill clintons north american free trade agreement nafta the massive trade agreements in the works to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind as in the case in the globalistcontrolled demolition of the middle east in iraq libya and syria displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees image by mark rain license dmca \\ndrastic action or hell on earth \\nif we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress then all sovereignty would be lost and most of the worlds population would become slavewage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into onecrop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite this must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary if we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out like poorly made cheap electronic products the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world this cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information with the un the world bank and the imf the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place influential nations on paper like france and the united kingdom which are still officially full fledged members of the un security council have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan we are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history image by imfarchive license dmca \\nthe semantics of deception \\nmachiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power however the advice the author of the prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of todays puppet masters words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify most of the time the exact opposite for example globalist eminence grise george soros open society foundation is an opaque giant ngo with more than  offshoots worldwide by its own admission but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching the recent publications of wikileaks in the voluminous podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing united states citizens john podesta may be viewed as a soros righthand man in the us in charge of delivering the returns for the globalists investments in the us elections the connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that soros financed podestas socalled center for american progress the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks the term progress is a lure that signifies power just like soros open society is in reality an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for soros chosen associates to savor what is apparent from the email treasure trove is that podestas job is really to supervise hillary clinton on behalf of soros in this context the expression leader of the free world to describe the us president becomes a lie the current world order of the globalists is anything but free and one applicant for the job hillary clinton is not a queen on the chessboard but a pawn',\n",
