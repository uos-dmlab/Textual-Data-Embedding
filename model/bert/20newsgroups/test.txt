kind argument cries comment wrote article scott compton writes jim originally wrote god create disease responsible maladies newborns god create life according protein code mutable evolve without delving deep discussion creationism vs evolutionism god created original genetic code perfect without flaw evidence code perfect degraded ever since evidence favour statement shouldnt perhaps biggest imperfection code full noncoding regions introns called intervene coding regions exons impressive amount evidence suggests introns ancient origin likely early exons represented early protein domains number introns decreasing increasing appears intron loss occur species common ancestry usually quite similar exonintron structure genes hand possibility introns inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns removed splicing mechanism would present unused introns inserted moreover intron insertion would required precise targeting random insertion would tolerated since sequences intron removal selfsplicing mrna conserved besides transposition sequence usually leaves trace long terminal repeats target site duplications found near intron sequences seriously recommend reading textbooks molecular biology genetics posting theological arguments like try watsons molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimores molecular biology cell starters remember question posed theological context god cause disease newborns answer likewise theological perspective less valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail fulfil criterion think misread meaning said god made genetic code perfect doesnt mean perfect certainly evolved since worse would please cite references support assertion assertion less valid scientific perspective unless support evidence fact claimed parasites diseases perhaps important weve thought instance sex might evolved defence parasites view supported computer simulations evolution eg tierra perhaps thought higher energy rays like xrays gamma rays cosmic rays caused damage fact thermal energy damage although usually mild easily fixed enzymatic action actually neither us knows atmosphere like time god created life according recollection biologists claim life began billion years ago would half billion years earth created would still primitive support life seem remember figure like billion years ago origination life earth anyone better estimate id replace created formed since need invoke creator earth formed without one recent estimates age earth range billion years earliest signs life true fossils organic stromatolitelike layers date back billion years would leave billion years first cells evolve im sorry cant give references based course evolutionary biochemistry attended dominion great feat satan genetically engineer diseases bacterialviral genetic although forces natural selection tend improve survivability species degeneration genetic code tends offset want true evidence supposed degeneration understand scotts reaction excuse farfetched know must jesting know pathogens know point mutations know everything come spontaneously response last statement neither may well believe accept fact cannot know hope dont forget evidence suggests everything come spontaneously evidence conclusion science one believe anything healthy sign doubt disbelieve right path walk take look evidence present ones conclusions prior theology use method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusions human dna complex tends accumulate errors adversely affecting wellbeing ability fight disease simpler dna bacteria viruses tend become efficient causing infection disease bad combination hence newborns suffer genetic viral bacterial diseasesdisorders supposing purpose valid move bacteria viruses exist cause disease another manifests general principle evolution replication saves replicators degradiation efficient method dna survive replicate less efficient methods didnt make present last time please present evidence claim human dna degrading evolutionary processes people claimed opposite true suppressed selection thus bound degrade havent seen much evidence either claim ask relevant discussion answering johns question genetic diseases many bacterial viral diseases require babies develop antibodies gods fault original question say course nothing evil gods fault explanation work fails miserably may right fact dont know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exists would inconceivable might responsible many ills affect mankind dont think could done much better job pun intended problem seems satan necessary explain diseases inevitable product evolution say seems like another bad inference actually youve done oversimplify said point summary words takes new context never said people meant presumably god punished getting diseases say free moral choices attendent consequences mankind chooses reject god people done since beginning expect god protect adverse events entropic universe expecting god exists expect leave us alone would also like hear believe choices indeed free interesting philosophical question answer clearcut seems consequences would expect rejecting allah oh admit perfect yet im working good library bookstore good starting point price tea china question provided answer biology genetics fine subjects important scientific endeavors explain god created set life processes dont explain behind creation life subsequent evolution behind proposition something supported evidence recommend books need invoke behind prime mover evidence whole universe come existence without intervention recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest people still insist

god rarely lord understand something words elohim jehovah use mormon leaders shall consider apostle mcconkies attack christians believing father jehovah trying prove jehovah refers exclusively christ mcconkie cited several verses bible verses mcconkies interpretation examined see whether right remember mcconkie said father jehovah elohim first example shall consider involves mcconkies interpretation ps verse stated spake david tongue touched holy spirit testified lord said unto lord sit thou right hand make thine enemies thy footstool ps two lords involved one speaking one greater one making provision triumph glory message contained messianic prophecy think ye christ lord asked certain detractors toward end mortal ministry whose son christ son god someone else born divine parent men mortal son mortal father descendant david matter great pride jews answered son david davids son truly much lord irrefutable logic complete discomfiture asked doth david spirit call lord saying lord said unto lord sit thou right hand till make thine enemies thy footstool david call lord son son david great king acting inspiration calls lord worships might add lord one spake unto davids lord question jesus interpreting words psalm saying means father said unto son elohim said unto jehovah sit thou right hand mortal ministry raise eternal glory exaltation continue sit right hand forever promised messiah pp emphasis added agreeing statement mcconkie following remark mormon pamphlet mormons think christ p reads lord elohim father said unto lord jehovah son brackets original mcconkie clearly stated elohim father speaking jehovah son psalm however one looks hebrew word translated lord becomes apparent either first lord father else father jehovah either way mcconkie wrong psalm reads lord jehovah said unto lord adon sit thou right hand make thine enemies thy footstool ps first lord verse jehovah mormonism says christ father second lord hebrew word adon singular adonai meaning master lord first lord father second lord son father jehovah son adon however father jehovah mcconkie claimed first lord jehovah son adon obviously father jehovah psalm son adon another example involves isa mcconkie stated following lord called thee righteousness isaiah quoted father saying christ hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie said father speaking christ passage reads lord jehovah called thee righteousness hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa according mcconkie lord refers father thine thee refer christ however lord speaking jehovah means either mcconkie wrong speaking else father jehovah another example involves ps verses mcconkie stated psalm says see laugh scorn shoot lip shake head saying trusted lord would deliver let deliver seeing delighted ps fulfillment jesus hung cross found words chief priests mocking scribes elders said saved others cannot save king israel let come cross believe trusted god let deliver said son god thieves also crucified cast teeth matt promised messiah pp emphasis added ps reads follows see laugh scorn shoot lip shake head saying trusted lord jehovah would deliver let deliver seeing delighted mcconkie said verses fulfillment jesus hung cross means person scorned verses christ lord trusted jehovah father another example involves ps ps regarding mcconkie stated following reference conniving conspiring plots incident lords arrest judicial trials prophecy took counsel together devised take away life ps role judas conspiracies psalmist says mine familiar friend trusted eat bread hath lifted heel ps promised messiah p apostle mcconkie said psalms refer christs arrest judicial trials shall first consider ps ps mcconkie quoted verse ps verse also included give complete understanding matter heard slander many fear every side took counsel together devised take away life trusted thee lord jehovah said thou art god elohim ps mcconkie said verse referred jesus christ verse goes tell christ trusted lord called god elohim mormonism teaches god jesus elohim father verse however reveals elohim man jesus jehovah father ps mcconkie quoted one verse however two verses considered examination yea mine familiar friend trusted eat bread hath lifted heel thou lord jehovah merciful unto raise may requite ps mcconkie stated verse referred judas role christs death since judas familiar friend lifted heel pronouns mine verse must refer christ notice beginning verse change pronoun thou refers lord jehovah pronouns refer christ used means christ speaking jehovah father verses another example involves mcconkies following remark ps one great messianic prophecies spoken mouth david says lord hath sworn repent thou art priest ever order melchizedek ps promised messiah p mcconkie admitted messianic prophecy involving christ question verse refers christ lord jehovah hath sworn repent thou art priest ever order melchizedek ps lord jehovah refer christ mcconkie right jesus jehovah father lord would refer christ one addressed priest forever order melchizedek bible reveals one referred jesus christ heb therefore lord jehovah ps father another example involves isa verses mcconkie stated atoning sacrifice future messiah isaiah said lord laid iniquities us pleased lord bruise promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie rightly said verses refer atoning sacrifice future messiah however failed mention also prove father jehovah verse reads like sheep gone astray turned every one way lord jehovah hath laid christ iniquity us verse reads yet pleased lord jehovah bruise christ obviously lord laid christ iniquity us bruised god father called jehovah verses remember mcconkie stated sectarians even believe jehovah supreme deity christ came mortality begotten son called concept misinformation untrue prove mcconkie misinformed believing untruth two scriptural references sam ps examined mcconkie stated following regarding scriptures midst passage clearly messianic lord says seed david father shall son sam second psalm whole also clearly messianic occurs statement thou art son day begotten thee ps paul quotes statements hebrews says prophecies christ would come son god promised messiah p mcconkie cited heb show sam ps refer christ would come son god since mcconkie first

would son messiah second example mcconkie cited ps examination include verse notice lord jehovah says thou art son day begotten thee declare decree lord jehovah hath said unto thou art son day begotten thee ask shall give thee heathen thine inheritance uttermost parts earth thy possession mcconkie said verses scripture clearly messianic acknowledged teach christ would come son god willing acknowledge however scriptures also teach father jehovah sectarians believe jehovah supreme deity whose son jesus christ begotten right belief another example involves mic verse mcconkie stated following truly lord act mortal ministry truly written shall stand feed strength lord majesty name lord god shall great unto ends earth mic promised messiah p emphasis added according mcconkie pronoun beginning mic refers christ mortal ministry lord god mic reads christ shall stand feed strength lord jehovah majesty name lord jehovah god elohim shall great unto ends earth obviously lord jesus

set apart ministry mission jesus applied passages quoting isaiahs prophecy lord hath anointed preach good tidings unto meek isa saying day scripture fulfilled ears luke promised messiah pp emphasis added first source mcconkie quoted ps reads follows kings earth set rulers take counsel together lord jehovah anointed mcconkie said anointed one christ true jehovah jehovah always christ anointed one

reduce amount cpu power spent raising lowering overlapping windows joe english ive found good font tiling x aka miscfixedmediumrnormal c iso biggest font know use sun x screen still get two column terminal windows sidebyside display overlap font suggestions accepted x server server make sure server proper match hardware monochrome monitor use monochrome x server monochrome sun havent noticed much difference xsun colour server xsunmono however pointed xsunmono k smaller therefore contribute less paging thanks jonny farringdon michael salmon server compiled also make difference jeff law advises us sun system x compiled gcc version unbundled sun compiler expect get large speedups server using bundled sunos compiler assume similar results would occur used one highquality commercial compilers market locking server ram anyone tried hacking x server locked ram get paged eg via call plock help performance ive one inquiry topic pointers plock function call hard evidence someone whos tried position give try thanks eric c claeys danny backx juan martin starting server joe english start lot clients xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner losh provided good explanation works summarized start x server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstations limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive experimented sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive even tried sleep exec startxclientsscript startxclientsscript sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm idea last one make sure xinit completely finished processing xinitrc settled steady state sleep expired clients launched yielded fairly comparable results stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use youll get speed increases loadup time one simple strategy choose small number fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also conserve server resources since fewer fonts loaded server farrell mckay joe english eg main xterm font x also twm set use x menus icons etc twms default font x since dont normally use x ive eliminated one font server oliver jones keep fonts local workstation rather loading nfs make extensive use r scalable fonts use font server resources file keep xresources xdefaults file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english one suggestion xdefaults xresources file try putting minimum number resources want available applications example reversevideo true separate resources individual clientspecific resource files example homelibappdefaults login file set environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation environment variables work ed xterm launches loads resources appdefaultsxterm xdvi finds appdefaultsxdvi forth note clients follow xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern check system appdefaults directory often usrx r libx appdefaults find proper name name personal resource files name documented xt specification pg thanks kevin samborn michael urban mike long kevin willing mail setup files inquirers method organizing personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every time starts doesnt seem make much performance difference might consider huge boon usability modifying applications resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch c style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered c style comments resource files simply silently aborted processing resource file loss preprocessing handy eg ifdef color enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs xvt find resources anywhere xdefaults starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey leedom possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm xdefaults file use separate resources files method clients seldom use define display properly client programs often executed machine server situation rather setting display environment variable hostname hostname name workstation set display variable unix access optimized routines know server machine use shared memory method transferring requests thanks patrick j horgan see display names section x man page explanation properly set display name dont think stock mit least data general hp libraries smart enough use local communication even display isnt

hopefully mit apply minor lines patch meantime want try email jody ed clients megabytes ram think carefully number programs running think also kind programs running example smaller clock program xclock unfortunately havent really noticed programs advertise large onus us research spread word suggestions better alternatives standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff welcome ed ive received contradictory advice people subject x client programs advocate use programs strictly xlib based since xt xaw toolkits rather large others warn us applications using may already loaded one shared libraries case using nonxt example client program may actually increase amount ram consumed upshot seems dont mix toolkits try use athena clients xview clients motif clients etc use one youre dragging

distributed xterm abandon hope ye enter undoubtedly ugly program distribution ugly maybe site still used suspect xterm one used clients many sites laziness isnt better terminal emulator available see must use xterm try reducing number savelines reduce memory usage oliver jones jonny farringdon xvt suggested richard hesketh available exportlcsmitedu contribxvt tarz dont need esoteric features xterm get hold xvt written save swap space xterm rather hog written partial clone xterm dont rename resources xvt pretends xterm current version cannot bind keys xterm ive heard versions xvt feature ive found yet update march recently email conversations brian warkentin regarding xvt questions whether xvt really faster xterm instance xvt may initialize slightly faster compare scrolling speed try quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap bs see program scroll faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirements dont hard numbers anyone else shared libraries shared text segments mean xterms paging requirements major experiment ripped tek stuff xterm made little difference since never use never gets brought memory stand conflicting reports validity xvt xterm summary caveat emptor mileage may vary provide hard data id like see specifically much ram occupies much swap needs relative speed mterm suggested der mouse available larrymcrcimmcgilledu xmtermsrcmtermballowax also terminal

questions asked imaginary theist questions cropped repeatedly altatheism since newsgroup created frequently asked questions answered companion article please note article arguably slanted towards answering questions posed christian viewpoint faq files reflect questions actually asked predominantly christians proselytize altatheism talk religion talking primarily religions christianity judaism islam involve sort superhuman divine much discussion apply religions may atheism atheism characterized absence belief existence god atheists go believe god exist former often referred weak atheist position latter strong atheism important note difference two positions weak atheism simple scepticism disbelief existence god strong atheism positive belief god exist please fall trap assuming atheists strong atheists atheists believe nonexistence gods others limit atheism specific gods christian god rather making flatout denials isnt disbelieving god thing believing doesnt exist definitely disbelief proposition means one believe true believing something true equivalent believing false one may simply idea whether true brings us agnosticism agnosticism term agnosticism coined professor huxley meeting metaphysical society defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin things must cause unknown unknowable thus agnostic someone believes cannot know sure whether god exists words slippery things language inexact beware assuming work someones philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic example many people use agnosticism mean weak atheism use word atheism referring strong atheism beware also word atheist many shades meaning difficult generalize atheists say sure atheists dont believe god example certainly isnt case atheists believe science best way find universe philosophical justification basis atheism many philosophical justifications atheism find particular person chooses atheist best ask many atheists feel idea god presented major religions essentially selfcontradictory logically impossible god could exist others atheists scepticism see evidence god exists isnt impossible prove nonexistence something many counterexamples statement example quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime numbers course deals welldefined objects obeying welldefined rules whether gods universes similarly welldefined matter debate however assuming moment existence god provably impossible still subtle reasons assuming nonexistence god assume something exist always possible show assumption invalid finding single counterexample hand assume something exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible places thing might found show isnt exhaustive search often impractical impossible problem largest primes prove dont exist therefore generally accepted must assume things exist unless evidence even theists follow rule time dont believe unicorns even though cant conclusively prove unicorns exist anywhere assume god exists make assumption probably cannot tested cannot make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove doesnt exist anywhere sceptical atheist assumes default god exist since assumption test profess strong atheism usually claim sort god exists instead generally restrict claims cover varieties god described followers various religions whilst may impossible prove conclusively god exists may possible prove say god described particular religious book exist may even possible prove god described presentday religion exists practice believing god described religion exists close believing god exists however sufficiently different counterarguments based impossibility disproving every kind god really applicable god essentially nondetectable god interacts universe way effects interaction must measurable hence interaction universe must detectable god essentially nondetectable must therefore case interact universe way many atheists would argue god interact universe importance whether exists bible believed god easily detectable israelites surely still detectable today note demanding god interact scientifically verifiable physical way must surely possible perceive effect caused presence though otherwise distinguish things dont exist ok may think theres philosophical justification atheism isnt still religious belief one common pastimes philosophical discussion redefinition game cynical view game follows person begins making contentious statement person b points cant true person gradually redefines words used statement arrives something person b prepared accept records statement along fact person b agreed continues eventually uses statement agreed fact uses original definitions words rather obscure redefinitions originally needed get b agree rather seen apparently inconsistent b tend play along point digression answer question isnt atheism religious belief depends crucially upon meant religious religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially sort god faith worship worth pointing passing varieties buddhism religion according definition atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power categorized worship meaningful sense widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many aspects human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well science politics watching tv ok religion surely belief atheism science still act faith like religion firstly entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually believes secondly necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions make sort sense sensory data experience atheists try adopt core beliefs possible even subject questioning experience throws doubt science number core assumptions example generally assumed laws physics observers sort core assumptions atheists make basic ideas called acts faith almost everything know must said based acts faith term loses meaning faith often used refer complete certain belief something according definition atheism science certainly acts faith course individual atheists scientists dogmatic religious followers claiming something certain general tendency however many atheists would reluctant state certainty universe exists faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof sceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit definition sceptical atheism beliefs strong atheism closer still doesnt really match even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data lack asserting god exist atheism religious surely antireligious unfortunate human tendency label everyone either friend enemy truth clearcut atheism position runs logically counter theism sense said antireligion however religious believers speak atheists antireligious usually mean atheists sort antipathy hatred towards theists categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad spectrum atheists take live let live attitude unless questioned usually mention atheism except perhaps close friends course may part atheism socially acceptable many countries atheists quite antireligious may even try convert others possible historically antireligious atheists made little impact society outside eastern bloc countries digress slightly soviet union originally dedicated separation church state like usa soviet citizens legally free worship wished institution state atheism came stalin took control soviet union tried destroy churches order gain complete power population atheists quite vocal beliefs see religion encroaching matters business example government usa individuals usually concerned church state remain separate dont allow religion say running state surely thats state atheism principle separation church state state shall legislate concerning matters religious belief particular means state cannot promote one religion expense another also cannot promote belief religious nature religions still say discussion purely secular matters example religious believers historically responsible encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning increase spending foreign aid founded religious campaigns long campaign concerning secular matters long discriminate religious grounds atheists quite happy see say prayer schools theres god care people pray people pray voters lawmakers tend things dont pray cant ignore also christian prayer schools intimidating nonchristians even told need join diversity religious nonreligious belief means impossible formulate meaningful prayer acceptable present public event also nonprayers tend friends family pray reasonable care friends family wasting time even without motives mentioned christians campaign increased foreign aid atheists arent atheist charities hospitals dont atheists object religious charities many charities without religious purpose atheists contribute atheists contribute religious charities well sake practical good atheists even voluntary work charities founded theistic basis atheists seem feel atheism isnt worth shouting connection charity atheism simple obvious everyday matter charity many feel somewhat cheap say selfrighteous use simple charity excuse plug particular set religious beliefs weak atheists building hospital say believe god rather strange idea rather like holding party say today birthday fuss atheism rarely evangelical said atheism isnt antireligious perhaps backlash ones upbringing way rebelling perhaps many people parents attempt force religious atheist ideas upon many people choose call atheists also doubtless case religious people chose religion backlash atheist upbringing way different hand many people choose religion way conforming expectations others whole cant conclude much whether atheism religion backlash conformism although general people tendency go along group rather act think independently atheists differ religious people dont believe god thats atheists may listen heavy metal backwards even may prefer verdi requiem even know words may wear hawaiian shirts may dress black may even wear orange robes many buddhists lack belief sort god atheists even carry copy bible around arguing course whoever chances met several atheists without realising atheists usually unexceptional behaviour appearance unexceptional arent atheists less moral religious people depends define morality obedience god course atheists less moral dont obey god usually one talks morality one talks acceptable right unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans social animals maximally successful must cooperate good enough reason discourage atheists antisocial immoral behaviour purely purposes selfpreservation many atheists behave moral compassionate way simply feel natural tendency empathize humans care happens others dont know simply way naturally people behave immorally try use atheism justify actions however equally many people behave immorally try use religious beliefs justify actions example trustworthy saying deserves full acceptance jesus christ came world save sinners reason shown mercy jesus christ might display unlimited patience example would believe receive eternal life king eternal immortal invisible god honor glory forever ever quote statement made court february th jeffrey dahmer notorious cannibal serial killer milwaukee wisconsin seems every atheist massmurderer religious massmurderer trivial morality survey conducted roper organization found behavior deteriorated born experiences respondents said driven intoxicated born done conversion similarly used illegal drugs conversion two percent admitted engaging illicit sex salvation freethought today september p seems best religion monopoly moral behaviour thing atheist morality mean thing morality atheists answer yes explained many atheists ideas morality least strong held religious people mean atheism characteristic moral code answer atheism imply anything much person behave atheists follow many moral rules theists different reasons atheists view morality something created humans according way humans feel world ought work rather seeing set rules decreed supernatural arent atheists theists denying god study freedom religion foundation found atheists responded became atheists religion work found religious beliefs fundamentally incompatible observed around atheists unbelievers ignorance denial unbelievers choice vast majority spent time studying one religions sometimes great depth made careful considered decision reject religious beliefs decision may course inevitable consequence individuals personality naturally sceptical person choice atheism often one makes sense hence choice person honestly make dont atheists want believe god atheists live lives though nobody watching many desire watched matter goodnatured big brother figure might atheists would like able believe god one believe things merely one wants true risks approach obvious atheists often decide wanting believe something enough must evidence belief course atheists see evidence existence god unwilling souls see many atheists previously religious explained vast majority seriously considered possibility god exists many atheists spent time prayer trying reach god course true atheists lack open mind assuming atheists biased insincere offensive closedminded comments course god arent looking properly likely viewed patronizing certainly wish engage philosophical debate atheists vital give benefit doubt assume sincere say searched god willing believe basically telling truth debate futile isnt whole life completely pointless atheist many atheists live purposeful life decide think gives meaning life pursue goals try make lives count wishing eternal life influence people live example atheist may dedicate life political reform hope leaving mark history natural human tendency look meaning purpose random events however means obvious life sort thing meaning put another way everything looks like question actually sensible thing ask atheists believe asking meaning life silly asking meaning cup coffee believe life purpose meaning atheists find comfort time danger many ways obtaining comfort family friends even pets less spiritual level food drink tv may sound rather empty vulnerable way face danger individuals believe things comforting face reality matter harsh might end decision individual concerned atheists unable believe something would otherwise believe merely makes feel comfortable put truth comfort consider searching truth sometimes makes feel unhappy thats hard luck dont atheists worry might suddenly shown wrong short answer many atheists atheists years encountered many arguments much supposed evidence existence god found invalid inconclusive thousands years religious belief havent resulted good proof existence god atheists therefore tend feel unlikely proved wrong immediate future stop worrying theists question beliefs dont arguments apply beliefs questioned similar weak atheism sceptical default position take asserts nothing strong atheism negative belief theism strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue theists question beliefs real harm cause believers everyone else sort harm religion represents huge financial work burden mankind matter religious believers wasting money church buildings think time effort spent building churches praying imagine effort could better spent many theists believe miracle healing plenty instances ill people healed priest ceasing take medicines prescribed doctors dying result theists died refused blood transfusions religious grounds arguable catholic churchs opposition birth control condoms particular increasing problem overpopulation many thirdworld countries contributing spread aids worldwide religious believers known murder children rather allow children become atheists marry someone different religion werent real believers claimed believers sort excuse makes real believer many one true religions hard tell look christianity many competing groups convinced true christians sometimes even fight kill atheist supposed decide whos real christian isnt even major christian churches like catholic church church england cant decide amongst end atheists take pragmatic view decide anyone calls christian uses christian belief dogma justify actions considered christian maybe christians perverting christian teaching ends surely bible readily used support unchristian acts cant much moral code bible word god couldnt made less easy misinterpret know beliefs arent perversion god intended single unambiguous interpretation bible atheist take one interpretation another sayso sorry someone claims believes jesus murdered others jesus bible told must call christian obviously extreme sorts beliefs questioned since nobody ever proved god exist must unlikely basic religious beliefs shared faiths nonsense hold pointed start dialogue positive assertions concerning existence entities inherently much harder disprove negative ones nobody ever proved unicorns dont exist doesnt make unlikely myths therefore much valid hold negative assertion default hold positive assertion default course weak atheists would argue asserting nothing better still well atheisms great many theists unfortunately popularity belief little correct whether works consider many people believe astrology graphology pseudosciences many atheists feel simply human weakness want believe gods certainly many primitive human societies religion allows people deal phenomena adequately understand course theres religion industrialized world find people believing religious explanations phenomena even perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may started means attempting explain world nowadays serves purposes well many cultures developed religions surely must say something really religions superficially similar example worth remembering religions buddhism taoism lack sort concept god christian sense course religions quick denounce competing religions rather odd use one religion try justify another famous scientists philosophers concluded god exists every scientist philosopher believes god one besides already pointed truth belief determined many people believe also important realize atheists view famous scientists philosophers way theists view religious leaders famous scientist human may expert fields talks matters words carry special weight many respected scientists made look foolish speaking subjects lie outside fields expertise really saying widespread belief religion indicates nothing entirely certainly indicates religion question properties helped spread far theory memetics talks memes sets ideas propagate human minds analogy genes atheists view religions sets particularly successful parasitic memes spread encouraging hosts convert others memes avoid destruction discouraging believers questioning doctrine using peer pressure keep onetime believers admitting mistaken religious memes even encourage hosts destroy hosts controlled memes course memetic view particular virtue associated successful propagation meme religion good thing number people believe disease good thing number people caught even religion entirely true least puts across important messages fundamental messages atheism many important ideas atheists promote following dont surprised see ideas also present religions moral behaviour mindlessly following rules especially sceptical positive claims want life sort meaning find search true even makes uncomfortable make life probably one youll good relying external power change must change somethings popular doesnt mean good must assume something assume

anyone check lets restrict christians want find commandments books regarded scripture whats going pass psychologizing answers whether dismissive open kind issue deal question theological point involved quoted often enough dont believe take seriously jesus said said love obey commands john like christian slave christ wills also instead younger brother still direction though call god abba christians therefore try find lord commands discovering feel obligated confess failure readers may set aside theologizing jargon slaves christ point adherents religion read texts whether classified inspired held models effort find application situations practice ranges devotional reading sermons like exegesis canon ical scripture word god highest pitch leads question whether find inspired scripture something act absolute guidance actions problem finding lord commands going set aside essay one major direction christians looked commands namely christian tradition reject tradition primary audience essay protestants deny tradition determinative value favor witness scripture question want deal commandments find lord scripture turns hard question protestant inquisitors would like turn discussion authority tradition accomodate unlike protestants episcopalians admit claims scripture b reason c tradition roughly equal standing earlier john quote read john give new commandment love one another place nt christians given explicit commandment context commenting imperative mode pronouncement jesus meal readers infer since john synoptics jesus says take bread body mark cf matthew luke corinthians mode imperative greek labete hence commandment cases infer command directed wider circle immediate collocation disciples judge evangelists point mentioning disciples mostly entirely dead expected follow commandment lord case communion pauls mention least probably true evangelists also implies ongoing ritual liturgy words operate bind christians original command disciples continuing commandment christian community entirely comfortable inference must point us occasion jesus spoke command take clear inference least evangelists notion christians called love one another jesus command directed disciples call attention inference command cannot apply without generalization specific context statement context disciple christ reading scripture make inferences get sense text whatsoever general problem reading texts cannot read without understanding native languages normally read translated texts without appreciation original context points original languages english misleads us going presume follows general problem read scripture control dont really think true suffice current purposes address issues arise already coped understanding year old text another world one live questions level introduce reser vations commandments issue found stipulating read texts original audience might done among reasons seeing johns agapate allelou general commandment merely instruction jesus disciples one occasion one linking synoptic great commandment criticism jesus limiting love congenially associate matthew ff read learnt said must love neighbor hate enemy say love enemies fact leviticus context quoted say hate enemy merely common human presumption leviticus pains say love extend strangers amongst people israel luke expanding q context goes jesus say even sinners love love suggests quite strongly id say limiting scope new commandment quite jesus mind short inference leads generalizing actual text command force christians objects limited christians trickier agapate allelou institution communion case great commission matthew mark twelve sent evangelize proclaim kingdom heaven close hand verb imperative kerussete context rather specific twelve specifiers turn steps pagan territory enter samaritan town lukan parallels even specific jesus final journey jerusalem make harder see generalizing christians previous examples hasnt prevented christians making inference call attention inference justified text unlike first two cases cite rhetoric evangelist urged reader still paul seems felt obliged proclaim kingdom heaven close hand even contrary jesus instructions gentiles ends earth christians also taken commandment sense john accept dont know surely rather speculative see ripples inference spread text pretext christians may infer general commandment applicable presented gospels specific occasion necessarily object kind generalization insist people make must understanding reasoning considerable length actually scripture assumptions involved reasoning scriptural though people best justify assumptions references scripture simply adds inference mix lets move great commandment love god whole hearts minds souls perhaps synoptic equivalent johns agapate allelou yet presented commandment texts rather context controversy pharisees cite matthew ff pharisees heard silenced sadducees got together disconcert one put question master greatest commandment law means obvious though accept jesus answer meant commandment christians answering polemic enemies marks account casts answer far positive light scribe version says far important holocaust need point word originates context animal sacrifice forget nazis sacrifice luke intermediate lawyer posing question disconcert jesus gets good samarian parable pains luke contexts confusingly various one could forgiven drawing inferences account said obviously taken commandment binding christians though think entirely reasonable conclusion case jesus thinks point mental gears grind cycle get conclusion commanded jesus contingent understanding point jesus use torah quite different gospel accounts application context us different contexts among synoptics curious noted luke get fixing command parable good samaritan may look analogous intent matthew gives golden rule meaning law prophets may also hear echo hillel saying generation jesus make associations think entirely reasonable indulging inference texts explicitly support us rather read texts kind interrelationship current literary theory calls intertextuality discussion agapate allelou apply beyond community disciples beyound circle christian believers applies buttress conclusion despite presentation saying explicitly commandment christians christians would disagree conclusions must point conclusions depend rather elaborate chains reasoning simply present texts contextual problem keeps coming severely look sayings jesus universally taken christians commandments get really hard cases take divorce mark pretty clear man divorces wife marries another guilty adultery cf luke except matthew escape clause except case fornication seems rather clear commandment whether take matthews reservation christians day take dont least practice rather peculiar jesus explicit whereas says nothing things people gnash teeth possible commands christ clear matthew disagree evangelists synoptic tradition im going continue examination evermurkier waters enough start theme finding commandments scripture exercise inference inferences informed assumptions cultural biases far identified commandments generally accepted christians yet already difficulties start surface difficulties want discuss next essay topic divorce commandment already strikes difficulties see almost evidence people eager find commandments condemn spend time writing nasty screeds soccouples misclegal horrors viciousness divorce demanding us law refuse allow refuse unrepentant divorcees places churches say divorce doesnt enter consideration general definitely matter concern even liberal church circles example wildly liberal episcopalian priest aqauintence wildly liberal diocese recommended couple approached marry
