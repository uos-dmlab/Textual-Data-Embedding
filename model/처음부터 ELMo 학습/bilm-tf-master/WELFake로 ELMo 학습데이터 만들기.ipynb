syrian civilians has brought the issue of refugees once again to the forefront of the political debate democrats ranging from hillary clinton to maxine waters have used the airstrike as an opportunity to call again for the importation of   more syrian refugees into the united states  rep maxine waters d calif slammed president donald trump on sunday for his temporary refugee ban and backed a moveon org petition calling for the united states to take in   syrian refugees the free beacon reported earlier this week former presidential candidate hillary clinton chided president trump friday for ordering airstrikes against the syrian regime at the same time as he attempts to bar syrian refugees from the u s urging the administration to recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting syrian babies and in the next close americas doors to them cbs news reported last week but for president trump and many republicans the airstrike presents an opportunity to   a concept president trump raised on the campaign trail the establishment of refugee safe zones overseas the summary of president trumps proposed budget for fy  released by omb in march suggests the administration may be including a funding request to establish such refugee zones the blueprint for the trump administrations fy  budget released on thursday allows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance including food aid disaster and refugee program funding in the state department breitbart news reported in march   the language of the blueprint however could be interpreted to suggest that the trump administrations significant funding of    the refugee program defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program as such a further reduction of refugees resettled in the united states in fy  could be entirely possible president trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign the refugee admissions program authorized by the refugee act of  has been surrounded by political and legal chaos for several years and that controversy has heightened during the campaign of  and the first months of the trump administration trump campaigned on stopping the flow of syrian refugees to the united states while hillary clinton wanted to dramatically increase that flow trump won the presidency in part based on his stance on refugees but his efforts to honor his campaign pledge have been hampered by court decisions that have temporarily halted both executive order  and executive order  overall the flow of refugees into the united states has declined under the trump administration but a significant number of refugees from the six middle eastern countries hostile to the united states trump attempted to impose a temporary travel ban on in executive order      somalia sudan syria iran libya and yemen   has continued unabated paying for the resettlement of refugees is expensive breitbart news estimated that the annual cost to american taxpayers to fund the resettlement of refugees exceeds  billion several cost estimates indicate that safe zones overseas would cost less than ten percent on a per refugee basis what it costs to resettle a refugee in the united states in addition to the financial cost of refugee resettlement the cultural cost to the united states is very high as well since refugees   especially from somalia sudan syria iran libya and yemen   have a long track record of failing to assimilate into american culture that failure manifests itself in several ways these refugees have been involved in a number of terrorist incidents in the united states somalian refugees in particular have participated in a number of terrorist incidents in the united states and been arrested for attempting to join isis then there is the huge public health impact of refugees again particularly from these six countries in the middle east breitbart news has reported for instance that the number of cases of active tb from refugees during the four year period from  to  exceeded   the increase in the number of refugees diagnosed with active tb from  in  to  in  was partially responsible for the increase in the total number of   cases of active tb increased from   to   during those four years other categories of   cases of tb that increased included those who arrived under regular immigrant visas which increased from   in  to   in   those who arrived in the other category which includes illegal immigrants called undocumented

s forces its shi ite muslim proxies in iraq and syria and its support for militant groups according to six current and former us officials the proposal was prepared by defense secretary jim mattis secretary of state rex tillerson national security adviser hr mcmaster and other top officials and presented to trump at a national security council meeting on friday the sources said it could be agreed and made public before the end of september two of the sources said all of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because trump has yet to act on it in contrast to detailed instructions handed down by president barack obama and some of his predecessors trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for us policy but leave it to us military commanders diplomats and other us officials to implement the plan said a senior administration official  whatever we end up with we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible  the official added the white house declined to comment the plan is intended to increase the pressure on tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants several sources said  i would call it a broad strategy for the range of iranian malign activities financial materials support for terror destabilization in the region especially syria and iraq and yemen  said another senior administration official    the proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation the official said the administration is still debating a new stance on a  agreement sealed by obama to curb iran s nuclear weapons program the draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if iran violates the  agreement the proposal includes more aggressive us interceptions of iranian arms shipments such as those to houthi rebels in yemen and palestinian groups in gaza and egypt s sinai a current official and a knowledgeable former us official said the plan also recommends the united states react more aggressively in bahrain whose sunni muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority shi ites who are demanding reforms the sources said in addition us naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the islamic revolutionary guard corps iran s paramilitary and espionage contingent three of the sources said us ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off irgc boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for  percent of the world s seaborne petroleum exports us commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered the sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules which are classified the plan does not include an escalation of us military activity in syria and iraq trump s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to iranian proxies in syria and iraq would complicate the usled fight against islamic state which they argued should remain the top priority four of the sources said mattis and mcmaster as well as the heads of the us central command and us special forces command have opposed allowing us commanders in syria and iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the irgc hezbollah and other iranianbacked shi ite militias the four sources said the advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert us forces from defeating the remnants of islamic state they said moreover looser rules could embroil the united states in a conflict with iran while us forces remain overstretched and trump has authorized a small troop increase for afghanistan said one senior administration official a former us official said hezbollah and iranianbacked shi ite militias in iraq have been  very helpful  in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that islamic state declared in syria and iran in  us troops supporting kurdish and sunni arab fighters battling islamic state in syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by iranianbacked forces in some of

       " 'prostate cancer study details value of treatments  the new york times a new study offers important information to men who are facing difficult decisions about how to treat prostate cancer in its early stages or whether to treat it at all researchers followed patients for  years and found no difference in death rates between men who were picked at random to have surgery or radiation or to rely on active monitoring of the cancer with treatment only if it progressed death rates from the cancer were low over all only about  percent of patients  years after diagnosis but the disease was more likely to progress and spread in the men who opted for monitoring rather than for early treatment and about half the patients in the study who had started out being monitored wound up having surgery or radiation the patients are still being followed which should reveal whether the death rate will eventually increase for the men assigned to monitoring doctors say the findings should help reassure men that surgery and radiation are equally reasonable choices in the early stages of the disease i can counsel patients better now dr freddie c hamdy a leader of the study from the university of oxford in england said in an interview i can tell them very precisely look your risk of dying from cancer is very very small if you receive treatment you will get some benefit it will reduce the disease from growing outside your prostate but these are exactly the side effects you might expect  active monitoring involves regular clinic visits with physical exams of the prostate periodic biopsies and blood tests for   antigen or psa a substance that may indicate the disease is worsening between  and  percent of men with early prostate cancer in the united states now choose active monitoring the study published wednesday in the new england journal of medicine was the first to include detailed information from patients about the side effects of treatment men who had surgery to remove the prostate were the most likely to have lingering impotence and urinary incontinence those given radiation reported bowel problems after six months of treatment usually with gradual improvement but not urinary incontinence sexual function also diminished after radiation but recovered somewhat but there were no differences among the three groups in anxiety depression or their feelings about how their health affected their quality of life dr peter t scardino a prostate surgeon and chairman of the department of surgery at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york who was not involved in the study said the research was important because there was little previous data comparing surgery radiation and careful monitoring in men with early prostate cancer dr scardino said the findings helped confirm that active monitoring is a valuable approach for many men he said that it was appropriate for a third to a half of men with early prostate cancers and that only a third of those patients would need treatment within  years but dr scardino emphasized that the monitoring must be done regularly and with great care for the rest of a patients life he added that an important message from the study is that early prostate cancer is not an emergency and men have time to decide what to do about it worldwide there were   million cases of prostate cancer and   deaths from it in  the latest year data were collected by the international agency for research on cancer in the united states about   cases and   deaths are expected in  the average age at diagnosis is  in the united states and the disease rarely occurs in men under  most men who have prostate cancer do not die from it according to the american cancer society the disease often grows very slowly     but not always some cases are potentially deadly but tests cannot always tell which ones the uncertainty leaves many men in a quandary particularly because of the bowel bladder and sexual problems from treatment in  the united states preventive services task force an independent panel of experts picked by the government recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer with the psa test the group said screening finds many tumors that may never have harmed the patient and leads too many men into unneeded surgery or radiation with their troubling side effects dr hamdys team set out to address the quandary they studied   patients in britain ages  to  who had early prostate cancers found with routine psa testing and then a biopsy if the psa was abnormal all the cancers were localized meaning they were confined to the prostate and had not spread to nearby tissue outside the gland or to distant organs the patients had psa measurements of  or higher and about three quarters had a gleason score of  the rest had higher gleason scores gleason scores are a measure of aggressiveness and range from  to  in cancers with higher scores being worse the patients were then assigned at random to one of three groups a third had surgery a third had radiation and a third had active monitoring though death rates from the cancer did not differ more men on active monitoring had progression the disease spread to distant parts of the body in  men on monitoring  who had surgery and  who had radiation the differences were statistically significant other progression to nearby tissue outside the prostate was also more common with monitoring  cases compared with  each in the surgery and radiation groups as time went on more and more of the monitored patients wound up having treatment dr hamdy said not all those who left monitoring actually needed treatment we know that  percent of them had not shown signs of progression he said adding that anxiety on the part of the patients or their doctors or some suspicion of progression may have pushed them into treatment robert boulton  a retired maker of rubber gloves was initially assigned to active monitoring but switched to radiation treatment after four years when his psa went up in an interview he said two doctors recommended the treatment and one opposed it so he went with the majority advice he said his only side effect was what he called man boobs swelling in the breast area from the hormonal treatment that is given along with radiation im feeling fine now he added no problems  another patient douglas collett  was also assigned to active monitoring in  and has stayed with it when he was first told he had cancer he wanted to get rid of it immediately he said but when he learned more about the disease and

convert military gains into a settlement that stabilizes the shattered nation and secures their interests in the region a year after the opposition s defeat in aleppo government forces backed by russia and iran have recovered large swathes of territory as islamic state s  caliphate  collapses     as unbacked talks in geneva fail to make any progress russia is preparing to launch its own political process in  president vladimir putin declared mission accomplished for the military on a visit to russia s syrian air base this week and said conditions were ripe for a political solution though washington still insists assad must go a senior syrian opposition figure told reuters the united states and other governments that have backed the rebellion had finally  surrendered to the russian vision  on ending the war the view in damascus is that this will preserve assad as president a syrian official in damascus said  it is clear a track is underway and the russians are overseeing it   there is a shift in the path of the crisis in syria a shift for the better  the official said but analysts struggle to see how russian diplomacy can  bring lasting peace to syria encourage millions of refugees to return or secure western reconstruction aid there is no sign that assad is ready to compromise with his opponents the war has also allowed his other big ally iran and its revolutionary guard to expand its regional influence which tehran will not want to see diluted by any settlement in syria having worked closely to secure assad iran and russia may now differ in ways that could complicate russian policy   assad and his allies now command the single largest chunk of syria followed by usbacked kurdish militias who control much of northern and eastern syria and are more concerned with shoring up their regional autonomy than fighting damascus      antiassad rebels still cling to patches of territory a corner of the northwest at the turkish border a corner of the southwest at the israeli frontier and the eastern ghouta near damascus eastern ghouta and the northwest are now in the firing line   the revolutionary guards clearly feel they have won this war and the hardliners in iran are not too keen on anything but accommodation with assad so on that basis it is a little hard to see that there can be any real progress  said rolf holmboe a former danish ambassador to syria  assad cannot live with a political solution that involves any real power sharing  said holmboe  the solution he could potentially live with is to freeze the situation you have on the ground right now   the war has been going assad s way since  when russia sent its air force to help him the scales tipped even more his way this year russia struck deals with turkey the united states and jordan that contained in the war in the west indirectly helping assad s advances in the east and washington pulled military aid from the rebels though assad seems unbeatable western governments still hope to effect change by linking reconstruction aid to a credible political process leading to  a genuine transition      while paying lip service to the principle that any peace deal should be concluded under un auspices russia aims to convene its own peace congress in the black sea resort of sochi the aim is to draw up a new constitution followed by elections     the senior syrian opposition figure said the united states and other states that had backed their cause  saudi arabia qatar jordan and turkey  had all given way to russia sochi not geneva would be the focal point for talks  this is the way it has been understood from talking to the americans the french the saudis  all the states  the opposition figure said  it is clear that this is the plan and there is no state that will oppose this  because the entire world is tired of this crisis  proposals include forming a new government to hold elections that would include syrian refugees  but  the time frame six months two years three years all depends on the extent of understanding between the russians and americans  the opposition figure said  if the russians and americans differ greatly the whole table could be overturned  russia is serious about accomplishing something with the political process but on its own terms and turf said senior international crisis group analyst noah bonsey  i am not sure they have a good sense of how to accomplish that and to the extent that they seek to accomplish things politically they may run into the divergence of interests between themselves and their allies  he said the syrian kurdish question is one area where russia and iran have signaled different goals while a top iranian official recently said the government would take areas held by the usbacked kurdishled forces russia has struck deals with the kurds and their us sponsors  from the start of the crisis there s been a difference between the russians and the iranians and the regime  said fawza youssef a top kurdish politician the russians believe the kurds  have a cause that should be taken into account  damascus while issuing its own warnings to the kurds may continue to leave them to their own devices as it presses campaigns against the last rebelheld pockets of western syria  the situation in the southwest is shaped by different factors namely israel s determination to keep iranbacked forces away from its frontier which could prompt an israeli military response  there are still major questions and a lot of potential for escalating violence in various parts of syria  said

the european unions decision takes direct aim at some of the countrys generous tax policies calling them illegal incentives in apples case local lawmakers in part worry that taking the tech giants billions could scare off other multinationals from investing in ireland just as other countries vie to entice them many people across the country are also upset that european officials are meddling

       " 'in major league soccer argentines find a home and success  the new york times guillermo barros schelotto was not the first argentine player to set foot on a major league soccer field statistically speaking he was the th when he made his debut for the columbus crew in  but schelottos phone still rings to this day more than six years after he left the league with calls from fellow argentines looking for advice though schelotto  is currently the coach of boca juniors the most decorated team in argentina most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams about other countries about a soccer world away from the   environment of buenos aires most of them like to talk about the cities schelotto said many of them find a way to come argentines now make up the   demographic in m l s trailing only americans according to the elias sports bureau going into this seasons openers  argentine players had been featured in an m l s   game since the leagues inception sebastian blanco a new designated player for portland made his debut in an opener friday and became no  in a ranking by nationality argentines have the   goal total too twelve of the  teams in m l s will start the season with at least one argentine on their roster a list that includes stars like dallass mauro diaz and montreals ignacio piatti and newcomers like atlantas hector villalba and new york city f cs maxi moralez why do they come for some its the money or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly others come for the lifestyle the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home or to live the quiet clean life that schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in ohio the portland timbers playmaker diego valeri was one such player who called schelotto his former manager and he eventually heeded his advice but he said it was for an entirely different reason a year before he signed with portland while under contract to his hometown club lanus valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his bmw with his wife florencia and daughter connie inside after that moment valeri said with considerable understatement we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world  within a year valeri who had had loan spells in portugal and spain was on his way to portland situations like that are very hard for the argentinian people to change he said the    valeri and his family are now settled in the northwest where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career he is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when portland won the  m l s cup championship game i think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here caleb porter valeris coach with the timbers said of his star and his countrymen they really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle thats different to how they lived in argentina they transition well into m l s  since  portland has signed six argentines including its   acquisition of blanco  valeri has been a good ambassador     he speaks english and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible to ease the transition but porter and the timbers general manager and president of soccer gavin wilkinson believe there is another more straightforward reason for argentinas outsize presence in m l s it simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires certain countries produce certain positions more porter said most teams are looking for that creative piece and you know you can get one in argentina  a large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for m l s teams and in the past the struggles of the argentine economy also favored north american clubs some said but there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north and that has dovetailed with the leagues overall transfer policy as the quality of m l s has improved as it enters its third decade its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports     which in the past had trended toward aging often european stars     and more toward onfield impact and value the latest class of argentines reflects this shift as they enter a league where the average age of designated players     the teams   stars     has fallen below  its lowest point in a decade they know that m l s is different to  years ago said schelotto who was  when he moved to the league they can go make good money play with some pressure they know they can make a career in the united states and then maybe move to europe ten years ago it was impossible right now you can  there are currently  argentines playing in the league atlanta united and its argentine coach tata martino brought in three ahead of its first season each of them  or younger villalba is just  buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in europe people are coming here younger and younger maybe to start their careers ignacio piatti a    playmaker for the montreal impact said through an interpreter its what they are looking for at that age being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games  piatti like schelotto has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of argentine talents considering entering m l s including players on both sides of the hudson river gonzalo veron  of the red bulls and moralez  who recently signed with new york city f c both acknowledged that they had turned to piatti for advice before signing at a community event in east harlem last week moralez     who spent four years in italy     reflected on his decision to move to the united states he had never been to new york city before signing he said and after turning to the likes of piatti and david villa for advice about the leagues standard of play he said he also sought assurances for his family who are set to join him in new york shortly first off i just want to enjoy football moralez said but also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country not everybody gets the opportunity to come here ',\n",

director james comey for delivery the next day in the prepared remarks comey confirms that he told trump he was not under fbi investigation multiple times as trump has asserted  comey said he told the president on january  january  and on march  that he was not under investigation they also show that trump had never pressured comey to drop the fbis investigation of whether there was any collusion between his campaign and russia in fact according to comey trump had said it would be good to find out of there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong in his remarks comey clarified conversations with trump that his associates relayed to the media     which showed trump never demanded loyalty or pressured him to drop any investigation on flynn or the broader russia according to a may  new york times report trump had told comey he needed his loyalty  the headline read in a private dinner trump demanded loyalty comey demurred  however according to comeys account trump never asked comey to pledge his loyalty and comey never refused as the times reported trump had according to the account said i need loyalty i expect loyalty  comey said he did not respond to the comment later in the conversation he said trump said again i need loyalty and that he responded you will always get honesty from me  he said the president then said thats what i want honest loyalty to which comey said you will get that from me  comey said he was not sure what the president meant and he did not ask leaving it unclear as to what trump actually wanted from him and what he meant by loyalty and in what context as the times also noted in the report throughout his career mr trump has made loyalty from the people who work for him a key priority often discharging employees he considers insufficiently reliable  comey also provided more context to a conversation he had with trump on february  in which the president reportedly asked him to drop the fbi investigation on his former national security adviser michael flynn whom he had dismissed the day before the washington post ran an article on may  that was headlined notes made by fbi director comey say trump pressured him to end flynn probe  however comeys account makes it far from clear that he was ever pressured  comey said the president said i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting flynn go he is a good guy i hope you can let this go  comey said the president then turned to the subject of leaks comey did not say whether he responded to the presidents comment which he characterized as a request  a white house statement at the time said the president has never asked mr comey or anyone else to end an investigation including any investigation involving general flynn  comey also clarified that he understood the presidents comment as a request that any investigation of flynn be dropped     but not the broader investigation into russia or possible links to his campaign  the former fbi director also addressed why he did not tell anyone outside of senior fbi leadership about the presidents comment he said he did not pass on that information to others in the fbi because he didnt want to infect the investigative team and because he did not intend to abide by the request he also said he had nothing to corroborate his story which he still does not and that he didnt tell attorney general jeff sessions because sessions was expected to recuse himself from the investigation they also decided not to tell the deputy attorney general who would not long be there in that role after discussing the matter we decided to keep it very closely held resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed he said comey said the investigation actually moved ahead at full speed  comey does not explain why he never told anyone in congress including congressional committees that oversee the fbi he will likely be asked on thursday why he did not come to congress in fact he told sen mazie hirono   last month that a situation where the fbi was told to stop something for a political reason has not happened in my experience  comey said trump had called him on march  and said the russia investigation was like a cloud impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country and asked what the fbi could do to lift the cloud  comey said he told him they were investigating the matter as quickly as they could he said he again told trump he was not being personally investigated he said trump had repeatedly told him we need to get that fact out  comey said he did not tell the president that the fbi and justice department were reluctant to do that since that would create a duty to correct the record if things changed but that he would see what we could do to lift the cloud i told him i would see what we could do and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could he said comey also said he called acting deputy attorney general dana boente for guidance but he never received a call back trump would call back two weeks later asking what he had done to make it clear that he was not personally under investigation comey said trump said he would have his people reach out to boente and that he told the president that was the way to go comey said trump said he would do that and added because i have

       " 'bucknell faculty dismiss academic freedom of expression bill  breitbart bucknell university faculty dismissed a proposal to adopt an academic freedom of expression statement at a faculty meeting that took place on tuesday on tuesday five bucknell faculty members proposed a bill to adopt a modified version of the popular university of chicago freedom of expression statement that protects faculty and students right to freedom of expression similar statements have already been adopted at several prestigious american universities such as princeton columbia johns hopkins and vanderbilt  in a vote the bucknell faculty outright rejected a motion that proposed a review of the universitys current policies regarding academic freedom a second motion which would have adopted a modified version of the chicago freedom of expression statement was tabled by a faculty vote after a professor allegedly expressed concern that a rejection of the proposal would lead to propaganda media reporting that the bucknell faculty is against freedom of expression another faculty member from the physics department allegedly expressed concern that establishing a commitment to academic freedom would run the risk of a young earth creationist taking his classroom discussion hostage the statement would have affirmed the universitys commitment to free and open inquiry and protected all members of the bucknell community in their right to express themselves no matter how controversial their opinions the bill would have also restricted the universitys ability to shield students from controversial perspectives the faculty affirms that as an institution of higher education the university should be committed to free and open inquiry in all matters guaranteeing all members of the university community the broadest possible latitude to speak write listen challenge and learn the university should fully respect and support the freedom of all members of the university community to discuss any problem that presents itself of course the ideas of different members of the university community will often and quite naturally conflict but it should not be the proper role of the university to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome disagreeable or even deeply offensive although the university should greatly value civility and although all members of the university community should share in the responsibility for maintaining a climate ofmutual respect concerns about civility and mutual respect should not be used as a justification for closing offdiscussion of ideas however offensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of our community speaking to breitbart news bucknell alumnus and political science professor chris ellis who was one of the five sponsors of the academic freedom bill expressed his concerns over what he considered to be the facultys lack of willingness to seriously consider the proposal we are deciding what we are as a university we should be able to engage in the same critical thinking processes that we claim to ask of our students he said i think it is important for universities to debate and ultimately articulate what their values are when it comes to free expression and intellectual inquiry when balanced against other aims of our university like inclusivity and the fact that we didnt have that debate is troubling to me he added i think its fundamentally important for universities to understand where they fit in the current political environment and at least in general terms express what sorts of intellectual and political debates are legitimate in the sphere of the university  ellis added that there are consequences to such ideological insulation those who hold the dominant perspective grow less accepting of alternative viewpoints most political science research shows that when one political perspective takes over a space what happens is that discourse becomes more extreme two it becomes less accepting of viewpoints that challenge the dominant view and three discourse becomes less grounded in logical and reasoned arguments and we begin to start from assumptions that certain positions are correct we start to question if we should let anyone let question the dominant view  this happens outside of academia as well ellis added anytime a   group takes control of a specific sphere what happens is discourse becomes more extreme and less rational and less accepting of alternative points of view we just happen to see it manifest itself in the american academy social psychologists have been suggesting this for many years  breitbart news has reported on many instances of   and political correctness at bucknell university frequent fox news guest and bucknell alumnus michael malice expressed on a breitbart podcast that going to bucknell was the worst decision of his life claiming that students and faculty rarely engaged with ideas that conflicted with their own during his time at the university former breitbart editor milo yiannopoulos faced unusual restrictions on an event at bucknell university that took place in february  administrators refused to allow students to engage with yiannopoulos directly instead choosing to force them to write their questions on an index card which were read by a moderator he was not allowed to stay in the schools   residence for guest speakers and was escorted   by university security immediately following the conclusion of his event before he would have been able to speak with students who wished to engage with him in early  bucknell professor marcellus andrews called for students to engage in acts of retribution against members of the bucknell conservative and libertarian political clubs who he called racists and fascists for their decision to associate with yiannopoulos administrators refused to even call andrews conduct inappropriate after repeated inquiries despite these absurdities the bucknell community often welcomes the presence of radical and even violent   ideology controversial christian minister and black lives matter activist nyle fort who has argued that under conditions of white supremacist terror revolutionary violence can be an expression of christian love has visited campus twice since january  bucknell students are often assigned controversial texts such as george sorels reflections on violence a book which argues that violence can save the world from barbarism and that violence used for the purpose of moving towards a classless society in the   tradition is

       " 'it happened personal notes from a young chicago cubs fan chicago cubs first baseman anthony rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked up as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the yearold catcher david ross who was a mentor to him rizzo ross and center fielder dexter fowler stood shouldertoshoulder singing that silly jingle the one that goes go cubs go go cubs go hey chicago whaddya say cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs fanlife is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom ricketts a man who donated  million to donald trump and bears a frightening resemblance to ted cruz so much that one might think ricketts was his brother the cubs also signed aroldis chapman a closer who served a game suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of wrigleyville with that said almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fanfueled folklore around curses defeat them that made the postseason truly blissfulthis is where i wrote thomas g my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalki live about seven blocks from wrigley field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they won i went down to wrigley field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to family who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet victory i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around clark and addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on iton sunday right before game  down  in the series i stood outside the friendly confines and said to myselfand to my father even though i dont really believe in this kind of stuff this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back also i bought a copy of the chicago suntimes after each game even the editions with the devastating headlines on game  and game  because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers sidebyside and forever see the journey the chicago cubs took and relive the heartwrenching and euphoric moments that took placethis seismic sports eventending the longest championship drought in american sports historygripped me like so many other americans it taught me once again the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a boss who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis but all too often we just go go go and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routineadditionally during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world stage where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity rizzo on the other hand as he now famously told ross during game  was an emotional wreck and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confessionmany of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the games unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the gamesill never forget how ross told rizzo it was only going to get worse in the th inning he was right the cleveland indians tied the game in the th acrobatic second baseman javier baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the th and fans had to bow their heads and hope chapman would not make a mistake even though manager joe maddon clearly overworked him the past few gamesstatue outside wrigley field of ernie banks photo by kevin gosztolathe weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of gift a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the th inning it was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first baseman ernie banks who was mr cub or legendary third baseman ron santo who later became a wgn radio broadcaster so rizzo the emotional wreck stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor grandpa ross who played his last game on november gramps and i sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with boston he was a free agent and we just talked rizzo shared we had the same agent were talking and i say to my agent man this is what the chicago cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together obviously a lot of pieces came through with that but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to mefighting back tears rizzo continued hes taught me a lot in lifeon the field off the field how to be a better person im forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his life he can say the last game that he played hes a world championthat to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all threetofour generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for this and many of them have parents who longed to see what happened if those parents are still alive their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world serieskevin gosztolafamilies shared stories about their first games games they remembered games they want to forget and games they saw with their fathers or mothers they shared stories of players they remembered or recalled when they first put on a cubs baseball hat or wore a jersey with their favorite players name on the back i dug out a photo of me when i was a toddler wearing my cubs shirti am  yearsold i waited  years for this because  was the first postseason where i really got into watching the cubs play and experienced what it meant to fail to end the drought when they lost to the florida marlins in the national league championship series that is a rather short time span when compared to legions of fansmaddon said its a players game indeed but for the cubs its unique cubs baseball was essentially a fans game much more so than other ball clubsthe last two years of decisions by business executives were made for the fans the scouts who went out and found these allstar players did it for the fans they recognized there were so many aging chicago cubs fans who kept asking them on the street if they were going to live to see the cubs win a world series theo epstein one of the executives who enabled this team did not want to have to tell any more fans to take their vitamins when asked if this would be the yeareven with  wins in the regular season and the status of number one team in baseball all too many fans were aware of the record for teams who came in to the postseason on top and did not make it to the world series we also took note of the statistics for comebacks in the world series when teams were down  so few ever win not only three games in a row but three games in a row including two on the roadthat put tremendous pressure on the cubs players they clearly felt it and we thank them for putting up with millions of emotional wrecksas fans process and revel in the fact that it happened as maddon would say how we did not suck i think about what this means for next year for the first time it is possible to watch the cubs without bringing a legacy of doubt and negativity to games there are no more goats there is no more steve bartman there are no more distractions that are not typically part of baseball everyones favorite punchlines dont really work anymore they all are part of the past and the immediate future is baseball with a team that will have some of the players who won this championship and who will undoubtedly find ways to dazzle us again as they attempt to repeat as champions in  for a coda chicago cubs fan caitlin swieca pledged a day after chapman signed with the team in july to donate  to a chicago domestic violence organization every time he got a save her campaign managed to raise over  especially when it took off after she shared it on twitterswieca told espn she thought during game  we all compromised what we believed in to root for this guy and hes gonna blow it then it shifted to a celebration cubs pitcher mike montgomery got his first career save ever and it was in game  of the world series she was happy chapman did not get the glory and said it couldnt have been scripted betteroh and at the parade some of us fans looked up to see a plane with a banner that read chinese americans for trump go cubs i stood next to a filipino american family who had some chinese heritage in their ancestry she thought it must be a joke then someone told her it was real they read something about this group of chinese americans instantly she said she was insultedwere not all trump fans because ricketts owns our team only a small segment are and they are the same kind of white men and women disconnected from reality who you will find in the fandom of just about every american sports team they would probably support trump whether ricketts was a cubs executive or notillinois governor bruce rauner and chicago mayor rahm emanuel were at the rally but they are both hot garbage neither took the stage to speak and i view that as some kind of small political victory that sweetens the victory over a baseball team with a racistcolonialist sports mascot which should be replaced immediately in fact lets conjure the curse of the racist mascot and say the cubs passed it on to them and thatll prolong their championship drought until they replace chief wahoo maybe then the indians will get rid of himthe post it happened personal notes from a young

intelligence officer annie machonannie machon consortium newsthe clash between plutocratic presidentelect trump and the cia is shaping up to be the heavyweight prize fight of the century and trump at least is approaching it with all the entertaining bombast of mohammed ali at the top of his game rather than following the tradition of doing dirty political deals in dark corners more commonly known as fixing the match trump has come out swinging in the full glare of the mediain that corner we have a dealmaking billionaire  man of the people  who to european sensibilities at least reputedly espouses some of the madder domestic obsessions and yet has seemed to offer hope to many aggrieved americans but it is his professed position on building a rapprochement with russia and cooperating with moscow to sort out the syrian mess that caught my attention and that of many other independent commentators internationallyin the opposite corner trump s opponents have pushed the cia into the ring to deliver the knockout blow but this has yet to land despite jab after jab trump keeps evading the blows and comes rattling back against all odds one has to admire the guy s footworkso who are the opponents ranged behind the cia yelling encouragement through the ropes the obvious culprits include the us militaryindustrial complex whose corporate bottom line relies on an era of unending war as justification for extracting billions   even trillions   of dollars from american taxpayers there was a need for frightening villains such as al qaeda and even more so the head choppers of isis however since the russian intervention in syria in  those villains no longer packed as scary a punch so a more enduring villain like emmanuel goldstein the principal enemy of the state in george orwell s  was required russia was the obvious new choice the old favorite from the cold war playbookthe western intelligence agencies have a vested interest in eternal enemies to ensure both eternal funding and eternal power hence the cia s entry into the fight as former british mp and longtime peace activist george galloway so eloquently said in a recent interview an unholy alliance is now being formed between the  war party  in the us the militaryindustrialintelligence complex and those who would have previously publicly spurned such accomplices american progressives and their traditional host the democratic partyyet if the democratic national committee had not done its best to rig the primaries in favor of hillary clinton then perhaps we would not be in this position bernie sanders would be the presidentelecttwoparty shamthese establishment forces have also revealed to the wider world a fact long known but largely dismissed as conspiracy theory by the corporate mainstream media that the twoparty system in both the us and the uk is a sham in fact we are governed by a globalized elite working in its own interest while ignoring ours the democrats openly disgruntled by hillary clinton s election loss and being seen to jump into bed so quickly with the spooks and the warmongers have laid this reality barein fact respected us investigative journalist robert parry recently wrote that an intelligence contact told him before the election that the intelligence agencies did not like either of the presidential candidates this may go some way to explaining the fbi s intervention in the runup to the election against hillary clinton as well as the cia s attempts to delegitimize trump s victory afterwardswhether that was indeed the case the cia has certainly held back no punches since trump s election first the evidencelite assertion that it was the russians who hacked the dnc emails and leaked them to wikileaks then the fake news about russia hacking the voting computers that then morphed into the russians  hacked the election  itself then they  hacked  into the us electric grid via a vermont utility  all this without a shred of factbased evidence provided but obama s expulsion of  russian diplomats last month solidified this dubious reality in americans  mindsall this culminated in the  dirty dossier  allegations last week about trump which he has rightly knocked down   it was desperately poor stuffthis last item from a british perspective is particularly concerning it appears that a washington dirtdigging company was hired by a republican rival to trump to unearth any potential russian scandals during the primaries once trump had won the nomination this dirtdigging operation was taken over by a democrat supporter of hillary clinton the antitrump investigation was then subcontracted to an alleged exbritish spy an exmi man named christopher steelethe role of mimuch has already been written about steele and the company much of it contradictory as no doubt befits the life of a former spy but it is a standard career trajectory for insiders to move on to corporate mercenary spy companies and this is what steele appears to have done successfully in  of course much is predicated on maintaining good working relations with your former employersthat is the aspect that interests me most   how close a linkage did he indeed retain with his former employers after he left mi in  to set up his own private spy company the answer is important because companies such has his can also be used as cutouts for  plausible deniability  by official state spiesi m not suggesting that happened in this case but steele reportedly remained on good terms with mi and was well thought of for a man who had not been stationed in russia for over  years it would perhaps have been natural for him to turn to old chums for useful connectionsbut this question is of extreme importance at a critical juncture for the uk if indeed mi was complicit or even aware of this dirt digging as it seems to have been then that is a huge diplomatic problem for the government s attempts to develop a strong working relationship with the us postbrexit if mi s sticky fingers were on this case then the organization has done the precise opposite of its official task    to protect national security and the economic wellbeing of the uk mi and its us intelligence chums need to remember their designated and legislated roles within a democracy   to serve the government and protect national security by gathering intelligence assessing it impartially and making recommendations on which the government of the day will choose to act or not as the case may bethe spies are not there to fake intelligence to suit the agenda of a particular regime as happened in the runup to the illegal iraq war nor are they there to endemically spy on their own populations and the rest of the world as we know postsnowden in a pointless hunt for subversive activity which often translates into legitimate political activism and acts of individual expressionand most especially the intelligence agencies should not be trying to subvert democratically elected governments and yet this is what the cia and a former senior mi officer along with their powerful political allies appear to be now attempting against trumpchances for peaceif i were an american i would be wary of many of trump s domestic policies as a european concerned with greater peace rather than increasing war i can only applaud his constructive approach towards russia and his offer to cooperate with moscow to stanch the bloodshed in the middle eastthat of course may be the nub of his fight with the cia and other vested interests who want russia as the new bogeyman but i would bet that trump takes the cia s slurs personally after all given the ugliness of the accusations and the lack of proof who would notso this is a world championship heavyweight fight over who gets to hold office and wield power an area where the us and uk intelligence agencies have considerable experience in rigging matches and knocking out opponents think for instance iranian prime minister mohammad mossadeq in  chilean president salvador allende in  iraqi leader saddam hussein in  and libyan leader muammar gaddafi in  syrian president bashar alassad is wobbly but still standing thanks to some

       " 'why corporate america is leaving the suburbs for the city  the new york times wilmington del     for decades many of the nations biggest companies staked their futures far from the fraying downtowns of aging east coast and midwestern cities one after another they decamped for sprawling campuses in the suburbs and exurbs now corporate america is moving in the other direction in june mcdonalds joined a long list of companies that are returning to downtown chicago from suburbs like oak brook northfield and schaumburg later this month the top executive team at general electric     whose   wooded campus in fairfield conn has embodied the quintessential suburban corporate office park since it opened in      will move to downtown boston when the move is completed in  the renovated red brick warehouses that will form part of g es new headquarters wont even have a parking lot let alone a spot reserved for the chief executive but even as they establish new urban beachheads business giants like g e are also changing the nature of their headquarters staffing them with a few top   employees and a smattering of digital talent rather than recreating the endless   pods they once built in the burbs part of it is that cities are more attractive places to live than they were  years ago and are more willing to provide tax incentives and young people want to be there said david j collis who teaches corporate strategy at harvard business school but the trend also represents the deconstruction and disaggregation of the traditional corporate headquarters he explained the executive suite might be downtown but you could have the back office and administrative functions in colorado the finance guys in switzerland and the tax team in the u k  reinforcing the trend chemours plans to announce on tuesday that it is staying here in wilmington after considering suburban locations most likely in the   headquarters it inherited from dupont when the chemical giant spun out chemours last year unlike chicago and boston wilmingtons urban renaissance remains a work in progress and chemours was very close to moving to a new home in southern new jersey or suburban philadelphia despite the dupont familys deep roots in wilmington and the state of delaware but the companys chief executive mark vergnano ultimately came to the same conclusion that leaders of bigger and   firms did to attract younger workers it helps to be in the city we are going through a change in our work force and we wanted to be where we could attract millennials mr vergnano said this is a group that likes to be in an urban setting with access to public transportation they dont want to be confined to a building with a cafeteria or be next door to a shopping center  to be sure cash from the state of delaware and other incentives played an important role in the decision as well in addition to providing chemours which produces a range of industrial chemical products with a   million package of grants delaware overhauled its corporate tax code sacrificing revenue and easing the companys tax burden as an added lure to stay put for wilmington where the unemployment rate of   percent is above both the national average and delawares overall   percent level of joblessness keeping chemourss  headquarters jobs in the city counts as a major win in a more perfect world states would be competing on the quality of schools infrastructure work force and so forth said gov jack a markell of delaware we live in a world thats not perfect so if other states are competing on the basis of these dollar incentives we need to be in the same arena  in an era of relentless   many corporate moves these days coincide with downsizing kraft heinz for example had   workers when the company was based in northfield it has   now in downtown chicago with advanced communications tools making it easier than ever to separate headquarters from other corporate operations location is increasingly being driven by function the first  members of g es management team including jeffrey r immelt the chief executive will move to bostons fort point section on aug  even after the move is completed about  g e employees will be based there hundreds of other workers in   functions like human resources legal and finance will be scattered among g es existing locations in cincinnati norwalk conn and schenectady n y the headquarters of motorola solutions will start moving to downtown chicago on aug  though more workers will stay in suburban schaumburg than move to the new offices near union station but for the first time in half a century top executives from the company will again be in downtown chicago where you work really matters said greg brown the chief executive of motorola solutions no disrespect to schaumburg but customers and new hires didnt want to come to the suburbs an hour outside of chicago we wanted energy vibrancy and diversity and to accelerate a change in our culture by moving downtown  mr brown and most of the executive team will be in the city along with data scientists and design engineers workaday functions like procurement training and supply chain management will stay in schaumburg over all motorola solutions will have   employees in downtown chicago and   still in schaumburg unlike many other corporate migrants the company did not receive any financial incentives to move mr brown said this was the right thing in terms of strategy he said millennials want the access and vibrancy of downtown when we post jobs downtown we get four or five times the response  as for g e executives were focused on moving to a city from the beginning of its search for a new headquarters said ann r klee director of boston operations and development for the company along with eliminating the parking lot workers are being encouraged to use public transit g e wanted to do away with security gates and the sense of isolation that characterizes many corporate campuses this is going to be the exact opposite ms klee said we want it to be open and to bring the public in with a museum and exhibits of technology like   printers  besides   icons like g e mcdonalds and kraft heinz venture capital investors and   are increasingly looking to urban centers particularly on the west coast said richard florida an urban theorist and professor at the university of toronto the period of companies moving to suburbs and edge cities has ebbed but i had thought that   would continue to locate in   nerdistans like office parks he said but a recent study by mr florida showed more than half of new venture capital flowing into urban neighborhoods with two san francisco zip codes garnering more than  billion each he said the return of a top echelon of executives to american cities reflects     and may well reinforce     disparities driven by widening inequality underscoring how jobs are disappearing in other locales over all there has been a slight pickup in employment and population in the central core of big cities said joel kotkin an author and urban geographer at chapman university in california but many   suburbs and neighborhoods are withering particularly in the northeast more distant suburbs and exurbs are still thriving especially in the sun belt the elite functions are going downtown mr kotkin said but at the same time   jobs are moving to the suburbs in places like dallas if theyre not leaving the country entirely  in wilmington local shopkeepers were elated that chemours decided not to follow its former corporate parent dupont to the suburbs anybody who has a business in downtown wilmington doesnt want to lose chemours said leonard simon whose   mens clothing store wright  simon has been around the corner from chemours since  im thrilled  jeffrey c flynn director of economic development for wilmington said that the advantages of city life ultimately proved to be a compelling selling point were not

th hole in a show of support as reed and holmes looked on moore produced an    finish to hand westwood a   defeat and deliver the united states its th point clinching the americans first victory in the biennial event against a european team after      losses it did not matter moore said that he was making his ryder cup debut while westwood was making his th appearance i saw both of those guys moore said and i said all right im going to do it for my team im going to try to flip this match somehow  the americans who had lost eight of the previous  ryder cups flipped their fortunes in the competition one man and one match at a time playing for one another the united states turned a   lead at saturdays close into a   victory its first against europe since  and only its third in the past  years patrick reed whose fiery demeanor and   play earned him the nickname captain america gained the first point for the united states in sundays singles matches with a   victory against rory mcilroy in a showdown of showmen that featured exquisite shotmaking   exchanges and a warm embrace when it was over by sundown every united states player had earned at least a point during the   event the last time that happened was in  when an american team captained by arnold palmer dominated a squad from britain and ireland it was the perfect tribute to palmer who died five days before this years competition got underway at hazeltine national golf club the united states captain davis love iii whose  squad squandered a   lead and lost on the final day at medinah country club outside chicago said he was proud of how his players competed in the face of immense pressure but mostly proud of the way they came together as family and supported each other love said brandt snedeker a player on that losing squad in  said this team was closer i think this week the underlying theme was everybody had your back he said snedeker was the only american to go unbeaten he said he could not have finished    if not for the support of bubba watson who helped him get past his singles opponent andy sullivan by  and  watson walked with snedeker during the match on sunday and kept him loose and in a positive frame of mind after snedeker fell two holes behind after three holes watson the   golfer in the world was not playing because he had been bypassed for the th and final team berth in favor of moore desiring to be included in the event watson volunteered to serve as part cheerleader part errand boy for loves team i dont know if i could have done it without him out there snedeker said of watson one of the american teams five vice captains in truth love had six assistants because everyone included phil mickelson     who at  qualified for his th ryder cup     as part of the captains coterie perhaps no one including love came into this competition with more pressure on his shoulders than mickelson who had spoken out against the status quo in the news conference after the americans   loss in scotland in  mickelson criticized the leadership style of that years captain tom watson who was seated a few feet away his   insurrection led to an overhaul of the system for selecting the players and the captain the players past and present got more input and a more collaborative process was put in place one of the changes instituted paved the way for the   selection of moore mickelsons contributions to the victory ended with his    record but started with that news conference in  at sundays      session the first question was for mickelson he was asked what he thought of loves leadership mickelson laughed along with everyone else on the dais we had a great week this week he said we had a lot of fun together as a team and we played some great golf and we are really excited to have won  when he was finished mickelsons teammates and their support crew applauded him we cant thank phil enough snedeker said adding he realized how this week turned out was going to reflect on him  percent and to have shoulders that big and go out there and realize youre going to have to shoulder it one way or the other     we all felt invested in that we were not going to let phil go down as a scapegoat  mickelson said he felt their support all week but especially sunday in his singles match against sergio garca it was an epic contest with the players combining for  birdies  by mickelson he had one bogey for a  but made a clutch putt at the th hole to secure a halve with garca and extend his career singles record to    his teammates mickelson said told me all the time they had my back and it was an awesome feeling  it elevated me to a different level of play having that type of support system he added i felt the support the energy and i played my best golf  after his last putt dropped mickelsons feet left the ground his jump was not as high as his putt was long but it didnt matter he got his message across the margin of victory was deceptive trailing by  points on sunday morning europes captain darren clarke had in desperation   his singles lineup his strategy sent shivers through the partisan crowds when no american player in the first five matches held a lead after the first nine the europeans pulled to within a point of the united states with victories in three of the first four completed singles matches but the americans finished strong led by moore and snedeker they won five of the last six matches while mickelson sat with his wife amy behind the th green soaking up the scene the european team featured six ryder cup rookies including thomas pieters who compiled a record of   pieters and mcilroy are not going anywhere so the united states cannot afford to rest on this win we need to build on this mickelson said otherwise its all for naught ',\n",

recently brilliantly played a central role in both brokering the recent  safe zones  deal   backed by iran and russia   and signing off a new trade deal with russia seemed to be rising above the

thousands of teachers judges and civil servants being rounded up on charges linked to an attempted coup in the summer of  right through to the worrying number of journalists locked up in jails which is constantly compared to north korea by many rights groups there are currently over  journalists in jail in turkey in a country where journalism has been pronounced dead under erdogan s brutal crackdownno matter that won t bother trump but erdogan s luck is still about to run out when he visits the us president who will bring him down to earth and show him exactly how much the turkish leader is worth as a regional ally we should all expect a bump followed by a tantrumbirds of the same feather could it be about personalities when we look at both erdogan and trump there are an alarming number of similarities which one might have thought would have played a role in bringing them closer both are nationalist leaders frothing over their daily ratings both extraordinarily thinskinned and more importantly equal in their colossal contempt for democracy and freedom of speech both leaders absolutely hate genuine journalists and what journalism as an empirical feature of democracy stands for the absolute truthbut they are not twins erdogan is a political animal whereas trump came into politics late and is driven by corporate power both though understand and resort to very shortterm political churlishness and buffoonery and here s where the worries lie with erdogan s plea for trump to stop backing the kurds in northern syria when trump sent  tomahawk missiles into an shayrat airbase in syria he was proving a point that he and america is ultimately a super power and super powers can do capricious illogical things like that and still come out a winner trump needed to prove to regional leaders that he is capable of exulting military might after nearly all of his middle east plans seemed to wane since taking office and it worked we may all be scratching our heads about the wisdom of hitting the syrian army s military infrastructure when the real target in syria is isis but it generated the media coverage and his popularity lifted back home when erdogan however bombed a number of kurdish installations a few days later   almost following the example of the us president   it didn t have the same effect turkey aspires to be a super power but in reality is a fledgling compared to saudi arabia and iran or even israelback home it was met with mixed reaction while in washington it backfired spectacularly the pentagon was shocked at how stupid the move was given that us soldiers were only about  miles from the bombing and if they had been wounded or killed then anything that erdogan would have hoped to have achieved would have been dashederdogan got the attention he wanted but he just made himself look like a loser in negotiations over how much power and support he demands in northern syria as a new plan to take raqqa unfolds and how the us should now consider no longer arming the only fighting group on the ground in syria which is fighting isis to any real degree the ypgerdogan is beginning to come across as a jilted girlfriend who keeps making the moves to get the attention of trump but who just keeps on getting the cold shoulder thoughhe has been hoping since january that the socalled architect of the attempted coup in turkey fethullah g len could be extradited by trump he has been also hoping for the kurds to be left out of the push for raqqa and he has been suggesting that turkey and the us should take the

unfolded this is not a us leader who will be intimidated with threats like the kurd bombing quite the contrary the result is that us officials and donald trump himself have started to humour erdogan for two chief reasons trump has investments in turkey and erdogan s ultimate threat would be to kick us soldiers and airman out of incirlik airbase and to sell it to the highest bidder on the geopolitical circuit the problem with erdogan trump advisers will no doubt be telling him is not that he has so little to offer militarily in the region it s that he can t be trusted they will point to his irrational relations he courts then rejects then restores again which makes him look erratic and untrustworthy   whether its erratic relations with israel russia or even nato and the eu there are just too many uturns erdogan sees russia as the new trading partner and this is where his real interests and loyalties lie and then there s iran considered by the trump camp to be the very crux of america s problems in the region and vehemently hated by most of his advisers who are planning to bomb it at some point    which turkey desperately wants to develop relations with both with trade and energy deals but it s not just iran and russia which will irk trump when he considers erdogan s last chance gambit to save the turkish leader s neck as he has to convince voters in two years that he   and his new antidemocratic grasp on the country s judges media and other key institutions   is the winning ticket for turkey no it s more about the relations that erdogan has had with groups in syria   like isis and jabat al nusra which few doubt were being supported by turkey at some point let s not forget that isis managed to swell its numbers dramatically by foreign jihadists crossing its southern border for a long time extremists were seen as a way to destabilize the assad government in syria hence allies of turkeyerdogan has left it too long to come into the antiisis theatre to be taken seriously and so erdogan s point of view that the us should not be backing the ypg and pyd in syria   due to their links to the pkk   is actually a triumph of futility as arguments go washington certainly the pentagon which trump takes seriously doesn t take erdogan s offer to take raqqa together seriously it would probably involve too many us soldiers whereas the kurd plan won t and the turks would probably shift the goalposts at the last momentrussia s foreign minister s meeting with trump is a different matter super powers meet super powers and important decisions are thrashed out when erdogan arrives he will be treated like an annoying neighbour who has arrived at the party late on the pretext of complaining about the noise but really wanting to just worm his way in for a free drink small people small issuesadversaries of erdogan close to trump will also no doubt be raising the obvious question of how far can the us trust a regional leader who just days before a referendum which would give him more power changed the voting rules which gave him the critical few percent at the pollserdogan s people have no confidence in their own leader in dcmoreover the unspoken but very real threat that he may attack the kurds on a grander scale is also not a point which trump will appreciate even from a political dimension it would make him look isolated and petulant as sour grapes never won anyone any votes at the polls but it s also the lack of confidence erdogan and his people have in their own arguments senior advisors to erdogan have told me that the washington trip is so important that they don t want to risk anything ruining the event yet how much credibility in the first place can you give to erdogan s visit when paranoia and a shocking lack of confidence in erdogan s ploy are so patently evidentrecently an oped article i wrote for a newspaper i have since discovered is erdogan s english language propaganda sheet was rejected because its criticism of trump might scupper the talks hilariously it was explained to me by one of the  journalists  on the daily sabah that  the talks are so important that we can t publish anything which is critical of trump    hardly a sterling mark of confidence from an erdogan fake news journal whose entire role is to promote the turkish leader if an innocuous oped from a british journalist in a propaganda sheet is all it takes to ruin the talks one could only assume that even erdogan s own people have no faith in their leader s arguments or charisma let alone his geopolitical edge where will the deluded erdogan go after this inevitable climb down i m expecting a grand tantrum and an even closer relationship with russia i m expecting some bombing of kurds and i m also expecting erdogan to play the incirlik card what i am not expecting is my turkish editors to keep their word and pay me what i am due for work which was commissioned by them erdogan s people just can t be trustedjournalist martin jay recently won the

of pneumonia said bill kux a cousin mr herz who worked on other radio and theater productions as stage manager and casting director for welless mercury theater company staked one additional claim to fame until about six months ago he had been a regular customer at sardis restaurant the   gathering place for celebrities and   tourists in the theater district for some  years     beginning in  just six years after it opened that longevity alone distinguished him as a bon vivant in a shrinking cadre of original broadway personalties but he was also singled out periodically in the wider world as a

       " ' watch obama just embarrassed the nra by ripping apart every single progun myth for the first four years of barack obama s presidency i chided him for being too nice to the stupid part of america as they spread ridiculous conspiracy theories about him   that he s really from kenya that he once worked as a  gay prostitute  to support his cocaine habit that he s secretly a shapeshifting lizard person and yes that he is coming for every single gun any day now   the president opted to sit back and absorb the attacks as he focused on more important issues eventually it seems he realized that as long as he entertained such monumentally stupid notions without taking a few minutes of his time to obliterate them those who spend their lives spewing such nonsense will not give him the opportunity to focus on what is actually importantlately the claws have come out the president is no longer willing to simply accept the lies spread by the nra fox news republican politicians and other rightwing groups without stepping in to correct the record gun shop owner doug rhude is a product of the misinformation throws around by the right during a qa session following pbs news hour we were treated to the perfect example of what happens when misinformation lies and bigotry are allowed to bounce around a bubble for the better part of a decadeknowing that we apply common sense to other issues in our society specifically like holding irresponsible people accountable for their actions when they drink and drive and kill somebody and we do that without restricting control of cars and cells phones to the rest of us the good guys why then do you and hillary want to control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers gun owners and responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us the good guys instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actionsas is customary rhude used chicago as his goto example of something demanding to know why  thugs  the goto conservative replacement word for  nggers  in the city are hellbent on murdering each other after taking a moment to process the almost offthescale stupidity contained in rhude s statementquestion obama politely yet brutally hit him with a massive truth bombfirst of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks  guns is just not trueand i don t care how many times the nra says it i m about to leave office there have been more guns sold since i have been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this countryand at no point have i ever ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it s just not true what i have said is precisely what you suggested which is why don t we treat this like every other thing that we use  obama continued pointing to another favorite rightwing goto topic auto fatality rates previously conservatives were able to mindlessly point out that  more people are killed by cars  than guns unfortunately for them and fortunately for the rest of us regulations and laws have decreased the automobile fatality rate to beneath the level of gun violence the auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously drastically since i was a kid  obama said asking rhetorically what is the cause of that the president informed rhude that   thanks to numerous regulations lots of studies and a strong and continuing effort    we have been able to reduce the number of people who die in cars no one took everyone s cars away   we simply arrived at the common sense decision to actually deal with the problem we are not allowed  to do any of that when it comes to guns because if you propose anything it is suggested that we re trying to take away gun rights and impose martial law  obama pointed out adding that we can t so much as study gun violence because republicans in congress have actually passed laws preventing this public health issue from being researched the notion is that by studying it the same way we do with traffic accidents somehow it s going to lead to everyone s guns being confiscated  obama pointed out i just came from a meeting today in the situation room in which i got people who we know have been on isil web sites living here in the united states us citizens and we re allowed to put them on the nofly list when it comes to airlines but because of the national rifle association i cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun  the president told rhude  this is somebody who is a known isil sympathizer and if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much   as many weapons and ammo as he can nothing s prohibiting him from doing that even though the fbi knows who that person is then he dropped the hammerso sir i just have to say respectfully that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws there is a way for us to make sure that lawful responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting hunting protecting yourself but the only way we re going to do that is if we don t have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the second amendment and that s how the issue too often gets framedwhile it is unlikely that rhude or any other rightwingers who heard the president s words learned a single thing one thing is for certain it s nice to see barack obama standing up for himselfwatch it yourself below featured image via video screen captures',\n",

       " 'special counsel mueller filing shows manafort drafted ukraine oped despite gag order washington reuters on friday   us special counsel robert mueller late on friday unveiled a trove of evidence against president donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort to convince a judge that he violated a gag order by ghostwriting an article to bolster his public image the evidence mueller revealed in a filing which is a fraction of what he said earlier on friday he has collected is the first clear indication of the depth of his investigation and the nature of what his investigators have found in the page filing prosecutors in muellers office produced emails drafts with tracked edits and records showing that a computer user named paul manafort created a version of the oped and made numerous changes on november  between  pm and  pm and last saved at  pm they also produced records indicating that the oped published on thursday in the englishlanguage kyiv post over muellers objections tracked talking points manafort and his business associate richard gates wrote in august  that was after manafort was forced to resign from trumps campaign because of political work he had done for prorussian figures including former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych mueller also claimed in the filing that manafort collaborated on the piece with konstantin kilimnik a russian to whom mueller alluded in a filing earlier this week as having ties to russian intelligence the filing did not disclose how muellers team acquired the data and jason maloni a spokesman for manafort declined to comment on it in the filing muellers team argued that us district court for the district of columbia judge amy berman jackson should deny a request by manafort to lift his house arrest saying the oped violated her gag order and demonstrated that he cannot be trusted bail is fundamentally about trust the filing said even taken in the light most favorable to manafort this conduct shows little respect for this court and a penchant for skirting if not breaking rules manaforts attorney kevin downing on thursday denied that his client had violated the gag order saying an article published in a ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the united states lnoh downing acknowledged in a filing on thursday that manafort had helped edit the piece but said it was his clients first amendment right to defend himself he did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on muellers second filing muellers team responded to downings first amendment argument by citing a supreme court case that found that free speech does not disable a district court  from taking steps to protect cases that could be harmed by the creation of a carnival atmosphere in high profile cases a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of muellers investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the  us presidential election and possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign russia has denied any meddling and trump has dismissed any suggestions of collusion the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former prorussian ukrainian president viktor yanukovychs government who was ousted in  manafort and gates are under house arrest and electronic monitoring but they have been negotiating to have those conditions lifted all parties were ordered by the judge on nov  not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial earlier this week muellers team discovered the draft oped was in the works and ordered manaforts lawyers to shut it down it was published on thursday under the byline of oleg voloshyn a former spokesman for ukraines foreign affairs ministry lnork on december  voloshyn emailed the us embassy claiming credit for writing the piece and accusing mueller of deliberately twisting the reality according to an email in the filing the article praised manaforts work helping ukraine secure better relations with the european union and said he lobbied for prowestern values not russian interests documents mueller filed with the court showed that gates and manafort worked together in august and september of  to craft narratives to deflect negative press about manafort after his resignation from the campaign need to beat back the idea that this was nefarious work a document said your efforts were in support and promotion of prodemocratic values around the world the narratives also claimed that manafort never worked in russia or for russians that his work was centered on proukraine efforts to enter the eu and that he never took cash payments manafort and gates are scheduled to appear in court on monday for a status conference hearing where the judge is likely to address the dispute earlier on friday mueller revealed in another filing that his office has turned over more than  emails financial records and other documents to manaforts lawyers to demonstrate what evidence the government has against

set of experiences that affect their political world than we havewomen under  probably have had women professors and bosses he adds they havent had the experiences that their mothers and grandmothers did thats why feminist messages just dont resonate with younger votersby contrast sanders is talking about issues that resonate such as not having a job or not making the money you wanted to or living in your parents basement he saysa similar assumption that doesnt pass generational muster is that americans couldnt possibly vote for a socialist those that are my age know its a political death knell he adds but there is a significant part of the electorate who werent born when the berlin wall came down younger voters see socialism as their trip to denmark or sweden or parisfeminist icon gloria

albright at a rally with clinton on saturday that theres a special place in hell for women who dont support women also fell flat among young women voters drawn to the promise of a social movement they were not only annoyed at being scolded but affronted by the idea they have to vote for clinton just because shes a womanduring the democratic debate on pbs thursday night clinton shrugged off ms albrights comment saying shes been saying that for as long as ive known her clinton said she has no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support i just hope by the end of this campaign

an essay in slateafter the new hampshire vote cultural critic camille paglia maintains that one thing thats driving young women to sanders is clintons overuse of i in the current campaign in contrast to bernie sanderss egotranscending focus on sparking a populist movement of political reformlost in the new hampshire outcome is the fact that clinton still has a core of supporters especially among nonwhite voters who credit her record as an activista getoutthevote rally for clinton at nashua community college last week was packed with supporters waving nea democrats for hillary a reference to the largest national teachers union which has long done much of the legwork in democratic campaignsshes been secretary of state how could you think someone like that wouldnt be a good president says faith little an online instructor of social work at boston university commenting on all the support for sanders among students she adds shes being realistic about what she can deliverclinton also has the support of much of the party establishment she has been campaigning in new hampshire primaries since  not only in the four clinton presidential races     but also to help other democrats in the process she earned the gratitude of many democrats here including us sen jeanne shaheen and new hampshire gov maggie hassanwho is running in a tight race to oust sen kelly ayotte rcritics say that establishment support doesnt count for much in what is an election defined by anger against the establishment the support of a governor and us senator did little to avert a clinton defeat in new hampshire but it is firing up controversy in the wake of that voteheres the issue governor hassan senator shaheen and four other superdelegates are now pledged to support clinton at the democratic national convention in philadelphia in july despite her blowout loss to sanders clinton could wind up with as many or more new hampshire delegates than sanders in philadelphiaif social networking buzz is any indication the issue is opening a new intergenerational fracture between clinton and younger voters who see the move as part of a rigged political system  a leading sanders talking pointin a statement after the vote hassan reached out to sanders voters no matter what the ultimate outcome of the nominating process senator sanders has importantly voiced the frustration of many granite

       " 'sanders dem establishment battle boils over with the democratic presidential primary in its twilight frustration within the ranks over the partys handling of the primary process spilled out this week as bernie sanders supporters lashed out at party leaders arguing that their candidate has been treated unfairlythe public outpouring of anger began last weekend at the nevada democratic party convention where sanders supporters who said hillary clintons backers had subverted party rules shouted down proclinton speakers and sent threatening messages to state party chairwoman roberta lange after posting her phone number and address on social mediathat led democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz senate minority leader harry reid and other top party leaders to demand an apology and publicly ruminate on the possibility of violence at the democratic national convention in july as they prepare for a general election battle with donald trumpobama administration officials on wednesday played down concerns about escalating tensions likening the race to the  primary fight between clinton and thensen barack obamabut sanders isnt backing down a campaign spokesman said wednesday that the campaign was looking into whether to ask for a recount in kentucky where sanders narrowly lost on tuesday night and he fired up his crowd in southern california tuesday night by calling out the democratic establishmentthe sanders campaign on tuesday did condemn unruly behavior from supporters and those who made threats to party leaders but made clear it is sticking with its stance that the party is subverting the process in a way that benefits clintonthese claims that our campaign is sort of fomenting violence in some way are absolute nonsense sanders campaign manager jeff weaver told cnns wolf blitzer tuesday night adding that the campaign absolutely categorically condemns any threatening behaviorthe breakdown in civility comes after what has otherwise been a comparatively polite campaign season for democrats but the frustration exposes a rift in the party and undercuts the notion that clinton will be able to march into the democratic convention this summer with a party unified behind herthe problem is that there are longsimmering concerns about unfair treatment out in the nevada democratic party weaver added we are not going to allow the millions of people who supported bernie sanders to be sort of rolled over in places like nevada by the way they handled that conventionearlier on tuesday sanders released a statement suggesting that his supporters were justified in feeling like the party has given them a raw dealif the democratic party is to be successful in november it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned sanders statement read unfortunately that was not the case at the nevada convention at that convention the democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking placein an interview with cnn wasserman schultz said that statement wasnt enoughi was deeply disturbed she said the senators response was anything but acceptable it certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel the firethe dnc chairwoman however said she has not spoken directly with sanders but that her staff has been in touch with the vermont senators campaign she also pushed back against sanders accusation that the party had rigged the system against himweve had the same rules in place that elected barack obama these rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in  she said they were followed and even if the sanders supporters were frustrated there is never under any circumstances a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to in responseon cnns new day wednesday morning weaver accused the dnc chairwoman of throwing shadewe can have a long conversation about debbie wasserman schultz and how shes been throwing shade on the sanders campaign weaver saidi gotta say its not the dnc he added by and large the dnc has been very good to us but not debbie wasserman schultzwasserman schultz brushed off weavers comments later in the daymy response to that is hashtag smh shake my head wasserman schultz told blitzer on wolf we need to focus on one thing get through this primary and work to prepare for the general election and make sure that we can continue to draw the contrasts between either one of our really fine candidates who are focused on helping people reach the middle class and make sure that we get equal pay for equal work and create jobs and not let the republicans take health

going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about itbut here we are in may as was pointed out biden continued hillary was still in this in may in june im confident that bernie will be supportive if hillary wins which the numbers indicate will happen so im not worried theres no fundamental split in the democratic partyleading congressional democrats also pushed sanders to rein in

condemned the behaviorhe should get things under control boxer said were in a race that is very critical we have to be unitedthis is a character moment for bernie sanders hes got to figure out how hes true to his values and his ideals fully said cnn political commentator van jonesi think hillary and bernie both misunderstand this movement i think hillary just sees it as just a bunch of rowdy kids that at some point will just calm down and fall into line he said later adding i think bernie actually only sees the good in his followers i think bernie really misunderstands there is a nasty edge to his following that hes not taking seriously enoughsen tim kaine criticized sanders responses in the wake of reports that democrats felt threatened at and following the conventionwhat he did yesterday was sort of say its the partys fault kaine told cnn that deflection of responsibility is not leadershipkaine added that the angry protests could be dirty tricksters in the crowd and not just sanders supportersi dont think we should assume that all of the people raising hell are bernie people kaine saidsanders goes after the establishment in fiery speechspeaking in southern california tuesday night sanders fired up the crowd by calling out the democratic leadershipthe democratic party is going to have to make a very very profound and important decision it can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change that is the democratic party i want to see sanders saidi say to the leadership of the democratic party open the doors let the people in or the other option for the democratic party which i see as a very sad and tragic option is to choose and maintain its status quo structure remain dependent on big money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy he saidthe crowd responded by chanting bernie or bust the equivalent of the republican nevertrump slogan for the democratic racehis speech barreled through his list of clinton contrasts comparing his stances with her and criticizing those stances on minimum wage fracking breaking up the big banks and her use of super pacsin response to the chaos in nevada clinton campaign manager robby mook simultaneously praised the passion and participation of sanders supporters while adding that clinton believes that no one should be intimidated harassed or threatened in this process he called on them to focus that energy on unifying the party a task that could be difficult given the raw feelings many sanders supporters have for clinton after the primarysupporters of both clinton and sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into their campaigns mook said ultimately we are

secretary josh earnest on wednesday downplayed any tensions between the two campaignshe recalled a similar tenor to the  contest between clinton and obama saying those tensions were no less intense

motivated supporters were good for democracywhile the spotlight this year was on the republican primary and prospect for a contested convention and protests at the national convention in cleveland

result of this happening this weekend we will have conversations both at the staff level as well as my having conversations with the candidates so that we can make sure that both campaigns are focused

the conventionthis was absolutely a serious concern which is why i said what needed to be said yesterday and others have said that there was real concern wasserman schultz told blitzer wednesday

       " 'some republicans see attacking obamacare through regulation washington reuters  congressional republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down obamacare following donald trumps election as us president including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation trumps victory on tuesday means republicans will control the white house senate and house of representatives but congressional democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against republican efforts to repeal the  law considered president barack obamas signature domestic policy achievement the affordable care act dubbed obamacare has provided  million previously uninsured americans with health coverage republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law which they call a government overreach wyoming senator john barrasso a member of senate republican leadership said one way for the incoming president and congress to attack obamacare immediately after trump takes office on jan  would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of health and human services the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law we could confirm someone on jan  who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers barrasso said in a telephone interview barrasso noted that the senate needs only a simple majority vote in the seat chamber to confirm cabinet members as opposed to  votes to overcome procedural hurdles the democrats could present to repeal legislation passing repeal legislation is not a day one activity but a new secretary of hhs going after the regulations can be a day one activity barrasso added trump during the campaign called obamacare a disaster and joined fellow republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like taxfree health savings accounts his transition website says trump wants a solution that returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states in repealing obamacare congressional republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around democrats in the senate where rules protect the rights of the minority party republicans in congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of obamacare in january but obama vetoed the legislation the bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law and would have eliminated expansion of the medicaid insurance health insurance program  republican representative chris collins of new york one of trumps earliest supporters on capitol hill said he hopes congress can pass a similar bill gutting obamacare within trumps first  days in office a promise trump made during the presidential campaign but some changes will doubtless be phased in over time collins said theres nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyones health insurance plan for  collins said in an interview from a replacement standpoint our position has always been as republicans to move forward in astepbystep fashion barrasso said in an interview with the wall street journal published on friday trump said he was considering retaining parts of obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age  on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions while waiting for congress to act on legislation the new hhs secretary could be reworking obamacare regulations barrasso said for example regulations could give us states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law such as exemptions from the socalled individual mandate requiring americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it kim monk an analyst at capital alpha partners which provides policy research to financial institutions said trumps hhs might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for obamacare insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill hhs might also be able to alter the language on essential benefits that the law requires insurance plans to cover which include trips to the emergency room maternity and newborn care and mental health services monk said the law requires they have to cover  essential health benefit categories but how that gets defined a lot of that is interpretative monk said and of course everything the obama administration interpreted was more more more more expensive coverage and all these things lead to premium increases collins a member of the trump transition teams executive committee said the job of hhs secretary or surgeon general would be great for ben carson referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination and later endorsed trump ',\n",

quality of his campaign has taken a more ominous turn in the past few days on saturday a man charged the stage in dayton ohio and a swarm of secret service agents surrounded the gop frontrunnerlater saturday at a trump rally in kansas city the candidate was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who were then removed from the venue outside the rally police said they used pepper spray to control crowds kansas city police said that two protesters were arrestedthe racially tinged anger that has both fueled trumps political rise and stoked the opposition to it has turned into a force unto itself it has also brought a reckoning from his three remaining rivals for the republican nomination who are shedding their fear of provoking trump and of alienating the raging slice of their partys base

i certainly do not condone that at all trump saidnow the outbreak of violence in chicago had again drawn focus to trumps temperament and character as well as whether he has played a role in inciting his supportersafter months of playing protesters to his advantage donald trump is overpowered in chicagofor months trump has been able to control  and even employ as foils  the hundreds of protesters who show up to his rallies to oppose what they consider divisive and racisttrump often says that he loves having protesters at his rallies that they make his rallies fun plus the interruptions are an opportunity to show him bossing around and mocking liberals often bellowing get em outin the past two weeks however these interruptions have increasingly eaten into trumps speaking time and become more violent the trump supporter who punched the protester in north carolina was charged with assaultasked about the criticism from other republican candidates following the chicago cancellation trump

reporter at a trump event  also said his candidate does not plan to do anything to calm his supportersthe american people are angry lewandowski said theyre upset at the way this country has been run theyre upset that this country is being taken advantage of by every other country in the world and theyre tired of not being proud to be americansas for trump he insisted that his supporters had been blameless in chicago he accused backers of democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders a vermont senator and democratic socialist of inciting the violencemy people are nice trump said at his rally in dayton thousands and thousands of people they caused no problem they were taunted they were harassed by these other people these other people by the way some represent bernie our communist

a pathological liar obviously while i appreciate that we had supporters at trumps rally in chicago our campaign did not organize the protestswhat caused the protests at trumps rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against latinos muslims women and people with disabilities and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of president obama sanders added referring to trumps

       " 'bob dylan the writer an authentic american voice  the new york times im the first person wholl put it to you bob dylan said in a  interview and the last person wholl explain it to you  the swedish academy which awarded mr dylan the nobel prize in literature on thursday has put it to us and it has no explaining to do to most readers and listeners however much they might have been pulling for philip roth or don delillo or margaret atwood this nobel acknowledges what weve long sensed to be true that mr dylan is among the most authentic voices america has produced a maker of images as audacious and resonant as anything in walt whitman or emily dickinson  bob dylan wins the nobel prize in literature  our pop critic on bob dylan the musician  it has never hurt that mr dylans words were delivered as the english poet philip larkin once put it in a cawing derisive voice that seemed to carry the weight of myth and prophecy mr larkin was not mr dylans greatest fan he found the lyrics to desolation row to be possibly    it took a different englishman the venerated critic and scholar christopher ricks to make the case most fully for mr dylan as a complicated and complicating poet in mr rickss sly  book dylans visions of sin he persuasively compared mr dylan at various points with personages as distinct as yeats hardy keats marvell tennyson and marlon brando dylans in an art in which sins are laid bare and resisted virtues are valued and manifested and the graces brought home mr ricks wrote he added human dealings of every kind are his for the artistic seizing  mr dylan born robert allen zimmerman in duluth minn in  was inspired when young by potent american vernacular music songs by performers like woody guthrie hank williams and robert johnson when his voice became fully his own in his work of the    s that led up to what is probably his greatest song like a rolling stone no one had ever heard pop songs with so many oracular tumbling words in them when bruce springsteen inducted mr dylan into the rock and roll hall of fame in  he described the opening seconds of that song this way that snare shot sounded like somebodyd kicked open the door to your mind  the words that followed pulled that door from its hinge in the chorus they posed a question that has not stopped ringing over american life how does it   be on your   no direction home  at the time dylan wrote in his masterful memoir chronicles volume one  i just thought of mainstream culture as lame as hell and a big trick  that memoir demonstrated that mr dylan could write prose as fluently as lyrics this needed proving only because mr dylans sole novel tarantula  written when he was  is a largely unreadable wordstew written so as to defeat the hardiest of his idolators as elvis costello said in his own recent memoir if you want a long career you have to drive people away now and again so they realize they miss you  everyone has his or her own private anthology of favorite dylan lyrics mine come from songs including idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth brownsville girl strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content hurricane written with jacques levy how can the life of such a   in the palm of some fools hand  sweetheart like you its done with a flick of the wrist and yea heavy and a bottle of bread written with the band pack up the meat sweet were headin out then theres this from blind willie mctell before this nobel prize mr dylan has been recognized by the world of literature and poetry in  the pulitzer prize jury awarded him a special citation for his profound impact on popular music and american culture marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power  his songs have always packed social and political power to match the imagery in his book the beautiful struggle a father two sons and an unlikely road to manhood   coates spoke of what mr dylans songs meant to his father as well as to a generation dylans voice was awful an aged quaver that sounded nothing like the   or silky rb that dad took as gospel but the lyrics wore him down until he played dylan in that addicted manner of college kids who cordon off portions to decipher the prophecies of their favorite band dad heard poetry but more than that an angle that confirmed what a latent part of him had already suspected  what was confirmed was this the vietnam war was a moral disgrace songs are not poems exactly songs prick our senses in different manner many of mr dylans lyrics can no doubt as mr larkin put look   when set starkly alone on a white page but mr dylans work     with its iambics its   rhymes and its scattergun images as the critic robert christgau wrote     has its own kind of emblematic verbal genius his diction focus and tone are those of a caustically gifted word man his metrical dexterity is everywhere apparent he is capable of rhetorical organization more often he scatters his rhetoric like seed or like curses this award is also a sign    after last years laureate svetlana alexievich whose work is made up of interviews     that the swedish academy is increasingly open to nontraditional forms of writing in what feels like a blow for common sense and scalding wordplay the academy has attended to mr dylans lyrics in lay lady lay to wit why wait any longer for the one you   hes standing in front of you in a  interview in the new york times mr ricks summed up my sense of the best of mr dylans oeuvre i just think were terrifically lucky to be alive at a time when he is

       " 'on shrinking us corporate tax base presidential candidates differ sharply washington reuters  the corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the us government but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it republican donald trump and democrats hillary clinton and bernie sanders have starkly contrasting plans some more detailed than others for taxing corporations the tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for  percent of the us federal tax base in the s last year it was only  percent internal revenue service data show  the decline experts say has many causes loopholes that cut corporations taxes a lower corporate tax rate rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax despite the dwindling corporate tax base trump the republicans presumptive nominee for the nov  election wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent in this regard he shares the same view as most republicans trump a real estate developer has described his proposals as revenue neutral saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas however the tax policy center a centrist tax research group in washington said that under trumps plan corporate income tax revenues would fall  trillion from  to  a cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made the center said steven rosenthal a tax policy center senior fellow said trumps plan is a standard businessfocused approach but the drafting is incomplete so we cant tell exactly what hes thinking   a trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because they say that would help corporations compete globally in addition some question the validity of the tax which they say is passed on to consumers and investors taxing businesses is the democrats version of manna from heaven someone else supposedly is paying for the government but all citizens are hurt through lower growth higher prices lower wages said grover norquist a republican tax activist taxes should be transparent it should be clear who is paying them the corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden said norquist president of americans for tax reform a smallgovernment group that opposes tax increases democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security services and infrastructure provided by government corporations have been taxed by washington since  clinton a former secretary of state and the frontrunner for the democratic nomination has not promised a corporate tax cut like trump she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes but unlike trump her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by  billion over  years the tax policy center said clinton spokesman jesse ferguson said the candidates proposals go further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share but the clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan sanders a us senator from vermont challenging clinton for the democratic nomination would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by  trillion in the same decade mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits according to the tax policy center virtually all of the revenue raised by senator sanders corporate tax plan would come from large multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes said sanders policy adviser warren gunnels  the question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with americans on the campaign trail an april gallup poll found  percent of us adults said corporations do not pay enough tax    since the mids income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at  percent of federal revenues while payroll taxes deducted from the paychecks of wageearners have soared to  percent last year from  percent in the s meanwhile congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate now  percent that is down from  percent in  and  percent in  over that period corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate  the corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses while other business structures have been gaining in popularity in  the share of us business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax  whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail no changes can occur without agreement by congress and despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform neither president barack obama nor lawmakers on capitol hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of byzantine complexity ',\n",

some of us suspected this internalized oppression is deadly in so many ways we must be nurturing and accepting of one another from an early age self hatred andor denial has implications way beyond the individual the family the community and ultimately the world our interconnections are profound and immediate they have a point not all hateful bigoted homophobes are straight cisgender people who think being lgbtq is so gross it has no place in our society some are lgbtq people who have internalized that bigotry because we have so many hatefilled homophobes who have very loud influential mouthpieces and who are trying to enshrine oppression of the lgbtq community in the laws that govern our land in the name of  religious freedom despite that chris hayes tweeted that this doesn t excuse mateen for anything and he s bangon right with that make no mistake there is no calling mateen anything but what he was   a murderer none of this would exculpate the sheer hatred rage and evil of this murderer or even explain it in any sense but it complicates  christopher hayes chrislhayes june  but hayes is right that it does complicate this because now it s a tragedy with its roots in a societal ill and that ill is this vile idea that the lgbtq community is wrong and dirty that their very identities are wrong and disgusting and that the only true way to practice a religion is to force it on others through oppression or worse violencethere s no way to know what was really going on in mateen s head his hate whatever drove it was so evident that it made his coworkers uncomfortableone of mateen s excoworkers at gs security told me he complained about the man s frequent slurs attacking gays and blacks  david ovalle davidovalle june    he would never have more than  or  sentences without using the word nr or queer or dike it was always about violence  he told me  david ovalle davidovalle june  mateen also dalliances at pga village neighborhood  all he wanted to do was cheat on his wife he had very little respect for women  david ovalle davidovalle june  whether he was driven exclusively by an extreme religious ideology that made him a bigot consumed with hate or he was filled a selfloathing that was so powerful and so allconsuming that it came out in a horribly violent pyroclastic eruption the tragic result is the samerightwing christians need to look in the mirror if they want to discover all the possible causes of this massacre because when it comes to the lgbtq community their values are identical the values of islam they re just as guilty as

who has been with the program through  straight n c a a tournament appearances the gonzaga bulldogs looked as   as any member of college basketballs aristocracy on saturday night and that was before play even began the   bulldogs   then stayed with built a lead on and survived a late scare from south carolina   which plays in the southeastern conference and had beaten traditional powers seeded second third and fourth in the past two weeks to make it to the final four but south carolina could not beat gonzaga whose   win put it in the national championship game monday night against another no  seed north carolina gonzaga had two talented players who are at least  feet tall     one przemek karnowski an experienced   senior the other zach collins a former mcdonalds   who could be drafted after his freshman season they made beautiful partners on defense with one blocking shots and the other collecting the loose balls two of gonzagas leading scorers nigel   and jordan mathews had transferred from   teams   who scored a    points also had a top high school rsum he attended the las   powerhouse findlay prep a cradle of recent n b a   draft picks this years success all made sense then gonzaga spent a significant chunk of the season as the no  team in the associated presss top  while the final poll taken just before the n c a a tournament began had the team at no  the advanced analytics website kenpom com ranks gonzaga no      and has every day since       as do advanced measurements like espns b p i jeff sagarins rankings joel sokols l r m c and sonny moores computer power ratings in other words you could be forgiven for not realizing that this was gonzagas first appearance in the final four more important you might not know that the bulldogs play in the   west coast conference an affiliation that denies them not only the millions of dollars in annual revenue taken in by members of leagues that sign television contracts influenced by football but also the opportunity to annually play a lot of other teams that are backed by such huge resources and are loaded with major talent it is not just    carping to wonder if the bulldogs at last can run with the big dogs no serious observer of college basketball thinks that gonzaga which made an    run to the round of  in  and has not missed the tournament since is simply a midmajor with a remarkable lucky streak its not  anymore south carolina coach frank martin said after saturdays game they were cinderella and all that pretty stuff  years ago martin continued adding theyre as   as   can get  but there is still a pretty wide gap between accepting that the bulldogs despite their structural obstacles are a very solid basketball team this season and believing that they are actually the best team in the country they have not been able to test themselves against elite competition as frequently as teams in the six power conferences have and the games they had against such competition came earlier before teams had a chance to jell in february while north carolina was busy beating notre dame virginia and louisville and losing at duke gonzaga was drubbing middling opponents like santa clara pacific and san diego theyre a lot more athletic in different conferences the redshirt sophomore josh perkins said although he added that the stellar shooting in the w c c required consistently frantic defense gonzagas ordinary scheduling has been aggravated by its tournament run during which the bulldogs have played teams seeded no  no  no  no  and no  yet kenpom coms numbers still rank gonzaga as the best team in the country     with the best defense and the   offense     after adjusting for level of competition and even after weighting more recent games ken pomeroy the proprietor of the website squared the circle by pointing not to the teams gonzaga had beaten but to how the bulldogs had done it obviously it doesnt say much when youre beating santa clara that game doesnt mean much pomeroy said but when you play a series of games against teams like that and win them all easily that does tell you something  in that light the picture becomes clearer gonzaga won  games by  or more points and  by  or more its average margin of victory entering saturday nights game   points was the best in division i the bulldogs beat   tournament teams like iowa state florida and arizona they also won three times always by double digits against their top conference rival st marys which received an   bid to the n c a a tournament in the tournament gonzaga beat west virginia a fourth seed that many believed was one of the countrys top  teams xavier which had knocked off highly regarded florida state and arizona and south carolina because college football and basketball have shorter seasons uneven scheduling and brisker postseasons than their professional counterparts much analysis consists of reviewing rsums but doing so invariably conveys less information than is often assumed there is nothing about playing a weak schedule     and even now gonzaga has played a weak schedule compared with other contenders     that inherently prevents a team from being great or the best of course as   said saturday we cant control who we played  he was referring to gonzagas tournament slate although the statement also applied to the bulk of his teams regular season gonzaga can control the outcomes however on monday night it will have the opportunity to make a statement for which there is no valid rebuttal',\n",

attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs can there be a clearer violation of our first

fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make

one inclined to tweak or entirely dispense with tradition     and with it the wearing of a wedding veil that bride she said can barely stomach the idea of wearing a white dress let alone a veil  another type ms guy said is more likely to conform her mother and grandmother got married in a veil and she will adhere to tradition  yet a third she said reads vogue and doesnt care about the traditional she loves the accessory element of a veil  whichever type of bride     in favor opposed or simply on the fence     her decision to wear a veil or reject it is apt be fraught heavily weighted by considerations of faith family pressures feminist principles and the no less compelling dictates of style but what sets this bride apart from her mothers generation is a ringing conviction that wearing a veil is less often a matter of custom than it is one of personal choice allison shoening  of centennial colo a project manager for a law firm is to marry in september she chose to wear a veil with the blusher the portion that covers her face i struggled with the decision myself for a while ms shoening said over all i like the look of a veil it adds an   element to my wedding  and a wisp of decorum if i go strapless i want to keep my look balanced she said i just dont want everything bare  others drop the veil or at least the blusher dismissing these elements as relics of male oppression about as unwelcome on ones wedding day as a pair of manacles when she married four years ago jessica huseman  left her head bare my   and i both find the idea of a veil to be a little silly she said pointedly ms huseman said we had this mutual agreement to share our lives it was troubling if you saw marriage as a partnership of equals to wear a veil  the idea of my husband lifting a veil over my face as his possession in front of our family and friends would have made me feel objectified she said those saying no to the veil included a number of women with deeply held religious convictions and strong family ties emily dause  who grew up in a family of evangelical christians saw no betrayal of her faith in replacing the veil with a headband for her coming may wedding it seemed to me that a veil is connected to being seen as a package something to be given away on her wedding day said ms dause a teacher from mechanicsburg pa it was disturbing that the veil has been viewed historically as connected to superstitions about warding off demons  she and others also see the veil as a symbolic reference to the virginity of the bride some brides sidestep the issue entirely said alexis swerdloff the    editor of new york weddings she said they replace the frothy length of cloth with a smaller more discreet head covering something like the birdcage a small veil that cups the face or the more   fascinator an ornamental headpiece customarily embellished with a wisp of tulle extending slightly over one eye such choices tend to be governed less by custom than by taste wearing a fascinator or alternately a garland of flowers or   comb is a way of saying oh so im a modern cool bride and i just like the way this looks ms swerdloff said meghan boledovich a restaurant forager at print in new york plans to wear a small veil when she marries in july i would wear it mostly because of how it looks she said according to the wedding report which tracks industry trends based on government data and surveys of couples the average amount spent on dress accessories mostly veils but other items too was  in  a drop of   percent from  in a   culture its not surprising that brides favoring the veil tend to be swayed by images of   muses like princess grace of monaco bianca jagger stevie nicks or more contemporary figures like catherine duchess of cambridge or jerry hall who married rupert murdoch in march with her head covered by a cloud of lavishly embroidered tulle as with many stylistic choices these things really come down to what people seeing in magazines on blogs and on the runway said ms guy of stone fox bride for inspiration she refers her clients to a roster of hip role models gwen stefani and solange knowles among others never mind that on her wedding day ms knowles had subbed the veil for a     white cape lindsay short a senior accessories buyer for davids bridal in conshohocken pa said she is seeing an uptick in brides

for the trailing veil and train ms short said it gives her that showstopping moment many brides still dream of  kristen maxwell cooper the executive editor of the knot said surveys last year of brides who use that   website showed that  percent bought a veil in contrast in  only  percent of the brides surveyed said they bought one sometimes choosing to wear a veil has nothing to do with tradition ms cooper said the feeling is that its just something beautiful if youre going to wear it its now or never  mara urshel an owner of kleinfeld bridal in brooklyn said that the company is selling as many veils as it did four or five years ago despite price increases some cost   or   or even as much as   for the type of elaborately embellished variations some luxury houses now offer to match their

brides who were photographed for new york weddings spring  issue did indeed wear a veil so eager were some new yorkers to make a style splash on their day of days they insisted on wearing an ultralong veil once relegated to the formal setting of a church or palatial estate in the most informal surroundings ive seen a lot of long veils on   brides wearing short dresses and getting married in a

how pervasive the criminality is in what has been only a  hour news cycleassanges lawyers are dead there are two lawyers who represented wikileaks founder julian assange who died and their deaths were in very close proximity only a  mere month apartassange attorney john jones suicide was committed by the top lawyer  when he jumped in front of a train in west hamstead in which the police did not even consider the possibility of foul play the authorities courtesy of the clinton foundation found nothing suspicious about the manner of jones deathmichael ratner made a career out of defending government whistleblowers and detainees something that one could argue was right inside of assanges  wheelhouse ratners death was shrouded in mystery it is important to note that ratner had actually sued three sitting us presidents and tried to get george w bush impeached for lying america into the iraq war certainly when someone like  ratner who had begun to represent assange was a terrible threat to the clintons and the clinton foundation and had to be dealt withchief investigator for bill clintons impeachment trial lives in fear of his life aaron klein yes the same aaron klein who released emails before they were purged which demonstrated that clinton was sending out through her personal server the travel plans of ambassador stevens prior to his death at benghazi recently interview dave shippers the chief investigator of bill clintons impeachment trial shippers professed that he still lives in fear of his lifetoday i am still terrified of hillary absolutely i am terrified because if she gets into office in fact ive told my wife i said if hillary gets elected look for the fbi or somebody to come and pick me up the next day and i think im the only one left former congressman henry hyde is dead independent counsel kenneth star didnt really hurt her yeah i was scared when i was out there ive been terrified ever since because things happen things happen klein allowed his interview to drift into the area of vince fosters alleged suicide which shippers was convinced that his event was a murder designed to cover up hillary clintons criminal behavior shippers also mentioned the impeachment investigation centering around clinton lying about his affair with monica lewinski uncovered evidence of at least three murders connected to hillary clinton however as shippers stated the investigation was limited to to the lewinski angle this is really ashame because of the fact that hillary clinton could have been stopped in the s and this nation would not today be fighting for its life under the threat of an extinction level event such as the specter of a clinton presidencyanthony weiner fears for his life at the hands of hillary clinton the perverted congressman who could not stop sexting grossly inappropriate images of himself to underage girls may have unwittingly put another very large nail in the political coffin of hillary rodham clintonaccording to sources  we now know that the fbi accidentally discovered that weiner had several emails that were suspiciously marked life insurance  and the fbi found that these email were directly related to the fbis investigation of hillary clinton disturbingly these same sources indicated that the sources were turned over to the fbi over  a month ago while the fbi was still running interference for the clinton crime family it is very concerning that comey never mentioned these damning emailsthe nypd had the same information and they planned to leak the information despite intense pressure not to do so this information not only shows that anthony weiner was in extreme fear of his life from the clintons that he actually created his julian assanges style of a dead mans switch in the event of his death i would add that huma may want to avoid subway trains and airplanes for awhile for her own safety i predict that weiner will become a star witness in either the immediate take down of hillary or her impeachment trial should george soros be able to steal the election for herconclusion for the good of the country hillary needs to step down immediately she has made our justice system and nation as a whole a complete laughing stock anyone and i mean anyone who would vote for hillary clinton needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself what kind

       " 'us state dept says assad is preventing peace in syria us proxy war nusra not cause for worry activist post a month after the last ceasefire in syria fell apart as a result of the failure of the united states and its terrorist proxies to adhere to just one of their obligations under the agreement the united states government is still claiming that the reason there is no ceasefire ongoing in syria is entirely the fault of president bashar alassad and of course the scary russians in fact on october  infamous narcissist state department spokesman john kirby openly stated that the only thing standing in the way of a permanent ceasefire in syria is the regime of bashar alassad the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters he said in other words if assad would just step down and let us have our way with his country we wouldnt have to keep killing civilians funding proxy terrorists and bombing syrian infrastructure doesnt assad understand that the us owns his country and that he is supposed to follow the dictates of washington regardless of what the syrian people desire the nerve of assad trying to defeat terrorists and maintain the sovereignty of his nation kirby did at least acknowledge the presence of alnusra but only tepidly we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam he said of course alnusra is more than just a mere spoiler it is open terrorist organization that the united states armed funded and trained to act as a proxy force that is no ideologically or even physically different than isis ahrar alsham or the moderates of the free syrian army it is also an organization that the united states was supposed to separate from the groups of these shadowy moderates we have heard so much about over the course of the last five years but who are apparently phantoms lurking about in the rafters of the syrian theatre the very fact that the united states blamed russia along with assad for the collapse of the ceasefire and argued that the us was not supposed to separate the moderates from the extremists until after seven days is thus an admission that without the requirements of the ceasefire in place the us would never have separated them at all but this was the crux of the us position essentially that it knew who the moderate cannibals were and that they were different from the extremist cannibals if that is the case then wouldnt separating the two be the goal all along why did the united states need to be required by a ceasefire agreement as a concession no less to separate the two different elements of the opposition if it was truly in support of defeating the extremists as joseph thomas writes for new eastern outlook  it also appears to be no coincidence that this scenario now openly unfolding in syria fulfils warnings published by western journalists as early as   seymour hersh the redirection  in which it was revealed that the us was already at that time providing material support to extremist organisations sympathetic to al qaeda toward the end goal of overthrowing the governments of both iran and syria while the us now claims russia has sabotaged us efforts to bring an end to hostilities in syria washington is also illogically attempting to argue that the failure of its feigned peace talks has also somehow prevented the us from targeting terrorists organisations in syria the alleged pretext of americas presence in syria to begin with despite strained relations with russia the us is still cooperating with moscow regarding the use of syrian airspace to avoid unintentional confrontations while the cessation of hostilities may have collapsed is there really any excuse as to why separating designated terrorist organisations from militant groups the us and its allies are providing billions in weapons and equipment to is still not an absolute and urgent priority the answer is no  there is no excuse or perhaps it is more accurate to say it is simply an excuse for the us to continue funnelling men and materiel into syria washington knows with absolute certainty will end up in the ranks of al qaeda whom the us admittedly intended to use as early as  to overthrow the syrian government with as a result the state departments ridiculous leveling of the blame for the failure of the ceasefire on assad can be chalked up to yet another statement based in absolute falsehood and intentional deception indeed this is the type of statement the us state department is becoming renowned for the world over from blaming russia for bombing a convoy even if it didnt bomb the convoy  claiming russian aggression in ukraine asserting that assad

       " 're early voting results in key battleground states appear to favor donald trump early voting results in key battleground states appear to favor donald trump   th  if you want donald trump   then you have got to be encouraged by what you are seeing so far early voting has already been going on in a number of the most important battleground states and up to this point the numbers seem to support the theory   doing significantly better in key swing states than mitt romney did in  as you will see below the latest numbers released by florida north carolina colorado and arizona all have good news for the trump campaign without a doubt i still have an   happen tomorrow night but so far at least there are some encouraging signs florida early voting has become extremely popular in florida and at this point close to half of all voters in the state have already cast their ballots  donald trump cannot win the election without floridas  electoral votes and so to say that this is a must win for the trump campaign would be a massive understatement fortunately the trump campaign appears to be doing much better in florida than the romney campaign did in  the following comes from politico  florida democrats increased their lead over republicans in casting preelection day ballots to nearly  as of sunday morning but the sheer number of new voters and independents makes it tougher than ever for experts to say whether hillary clinton has a clear advantage over donald trump in the nations biggest battleground state of the record  million inperson early votes and absentee ballots cast democrats have an advantage over republicans of only  percentage points with each party casting roughly  percent of the ballots though its a lead for democrats theyre not going to match their percentagepoint lead in early votes by election day they enjoyed in  and republicans tend to outvote democrats on election day in florida on monday updated numbers for florida were released and we found out that the democrats had increased their lead to about  votes but trump is still doing much better than romney was at this stage and the trump campaign also has to be happy about the fact that firsttime voters account for  percent of all the votes cast so far throughout this election cycle trump has shown that he can bring out people that have never voted before and so officials in the trump campaign have to be smiling about this however one sign of trouble for the trump campaign is the fact that there has been a  percent increase in early voting by hispanics in florida compared to  and this appears to be fueled by dislike for trump the following comes from the miami herald  through saturday  hispanics had completed early inperson voting in florida a  percent increase over  according to an analysis by dan smith a university of florida political science professor who tracks voting data including absentee ballots  hispanics have voted  more than a third of whom did not vote in  were witnessing explosive early voting turnout of hispanics  both those newly registered to vote as well as those who sat on the sidelines in  smith said as discussed above republicans tend to outvote democrats on election day in florida so the key for the trump campaign will be to have the same kind of election day turnout that the romney campaign had in  if trump wins florida he will have a legitimate shot at winning the election but if he loses the state it will be virtually impossible for him to make up those  electoral votes elsewhere on the map north carolina another state that the trump campaign desperately needs is north carolina mitt romney won this state back in  and according to the drudge report the trump campaign is doing even better than the romney campaign did during early voting another dramatic turn of events is being reported out of north carolina this afternoon donald trump has jumped past all expectations in early voting in  romney hit election day down  votes based on early ballots he went on to win the state by  votes now the drudge report can reveal trump opens election day down  north carolina is another of the key battleground states that is going to help decide the election while not as important as florida the truth is that donald trump pretty much has to have it to have a legitimate shot colorado all along most of the pundits have pretty much assumed that hillary clinton was going to win colorado unfortunately for her the denver post is reporting that the number of republicans that have voted so far exceeds the number of democrats that have voted republicans took the lead in early voting in colorado   friday and held the advantage through the weekend despite robust democratic getoutthevote efforts the latest early voting numbers released monday morning show registered republicans cast  ballots compared to  registered democrats  a  vote gop advantage the breakdown looks like this  percent republican  percent democrat and  percent unaffiliated if donald trump could find a way to actually win colorado that would definitely lessen the pressure of having to win nevada where he is not doing nearly as well so far arizona the state of arizona used to be considered deep red territory but during this election cycle it has been considered a battleground state fortunately for trump the poll numbers in arizona have shifted in his direction in recent days and the early numbers coming out of the state look very good for him  the republican lead in absentee ballots returned is  bill dunn the partys director of early and absentee voting said republicans lead with  percent of absentee ballots requested but have an even greater advantage in absentee ballots returned at  percent of the total in the waning days of the campaign donald trump has been crisscrossing the country and he continues to draw absolutely enormous crowds conservative voters are far more enthusiastic about trump than they were about romney but will it be enough the scene here in sterling heights michigan just before trumps next rally pictwittercomoxutnexun  jill colvin colvinj november   some republican strategists are convinced that it will not be enough in fact one of them told cnn that he believes   going to win by an electoral landslide hillary clinton will win in an electoral landslide on tuesday but the political baggage she has accumulated over the past yearandahalf will dissuade congressional republicans from working with her administration says longtime republican political strategist john weaver i believe shes going to win in an electoral landslide and be the most unpopular president in electoral history which is quite the paradox weaver told david axelrod on the axe files podcast produced by the university of chicago institute of politics and cnn and ultimately it could be the establishment republicans and the nevertrumpers that make the difference and deliver the election to hillary clinton if you can believe it some establishment republicans are actually publicly announcing that they have voted for hillary clinton and are encouraging others to do the same if they can get just five percent of republicans to follow them they could completely alter the outcome of the election so let us hope that does not happen on a positive note on monday we learned that hillary clinton has canceled her celebratory fireworks for tuesday night no reason was given for why the fireworks were canceled but many are taking this as a sign that the clinton campaign may not be as optimistic as they were previously in any event we dont have long to wait now until we find out who wins and who loses if you want donald trump to win please go vote because america may never be faced with this kind of a choice again i am absolutely convinced that this is a pivotal moment in american history and on tuesday night we find out what happens may god have mercy on the late great united states of

understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western

the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to

       " 'a sharp exchange over electionyear polling offers thoughts for the rest of us in a political season marked by nonstop polling a lively exchange took place recently about the state of public opinion research and what to believe about all of the numbers describing the state of the racethe context for the discussion was set by a series of national and state surveys showing donald trump gaining on or overtaking hillary clinton in the generalelection campaign it broadened into an examination how polls are produced and used in a competitive media environmentearlier this spring clinton enjoyed a substantial lead over trump now the realclearpolitics poll average in the presidential race shows clinton with a lead of just one point  to  percent some recent polls showed trump ahead including a washington postabc news poll of registered voters released a week agothe shift raised questions is this merely a bounce for trump because he has wrapped up the republican nomination while clinton is still fighting a campaign against bernie sanders in that case will clinton reverse trumps gains once she has claimed the democratic nomination do the current polls mean that the general election will be close and hardfought most provocatively is there something wrong with some of these pollsthe first salvo in the exchange came from norman j ornstein of the american enterprise institute and alan i abramowitz a political scientist at emory university both are scholars to whom ive gone many times as ive reported campaigns and politics generally the two coauthored an oped for the new york times titled stop the polling insanitythey pointed to what they said were wild fluctuations and surprising results in recent trumpclinton polls they also underscored how news organizations are producing polls at a rapid rate and using them to make news and generate clicks too many of this years polls and their coverage have been cringeworthy they wroteornstein and abramowitz took issue with a reutersipsos tracking poll that showed clinton with a point lead on may a tie five days later and then a sixpoint lead for clinton on may  they questioned whether opinions could have shifted that much during a time when there were no major events in the campaignthey challenged an online nbcsurveymonkey poll that showed trump within three points of clinton and said that trump was receiving percent of the hispanic vote when most other surveys have shown mr trump eking out  to  percent among latino votersthey also raised doubts about a trio of quinnipiac polls in the battleground states of florida ohio and pennsylvania arguing that the samples used in the surveys were whiter than the states had in  exit pollswhen polling aficionados see results that seem surprising or unusual the first instinct is to look under the hood at things like demographic and partisan distributions they wrote when cable news hosts and talking heads see these kinds of results they exult report and analyze ad nauseam caveats or cautions are rarely includedthe two scholars went on to cite wellknown challenges for all types of polls traditional polls considered the most reliable over a long period of time use random samples of the population call landlines and cellphones and use real people to conduct the interviews but those surveys are extremely costly and response rates for many have plummeted over the yearsonline surveys use panels of potential respondents rather than randomly drawn samples the methodology differs among the practitioners and is in a regular state of examination and refinement they are much less expensive to produceornstein and abramowitzs oped prompted a rejoinder from jon cohen surveymonkeys chief research officer and mark blumenthal the firms head of election polling for the record cohen is a former polling director at the post and someone with whom ive worked closely and collaboratively over many yearsthe surveymonkey duo took issue with the suggestion that polls showing trump and clinton in a close race are almost by definition to be questioned its not enough for trumps opponents to wish him away they wrote its important for political professionals to actually explore what is buoying trump  even if they find his rise unfathomablethey argued that the polls have not been on a wild ride in fact they said there was a clear trend based on the moving average of an average of all polls once trump became the presumptive gop nominee after his victory in the may  indiana primary clintons lead began to shrinkas for the nbcsurveymonkey poll showing trump winning percent of the hispanic vote they noted that six other national surveys taken after the reality tv star effectively secured the nomination showed his hispanic support ranging from percent to percent while acknowledging they were on the high end but they said clintons margin over trump among hispanics across the six polls ranged from points to points the nbcsurveymonkey polls margin was in the middle of that range at  pointsciting the late andrew kohut the founder of pew research they said those in the field of survey research should be measurers not handicappers now more than ever at this moment of reinvention for public opinion polling we need many independent estimates of voter preferences not a herd of handicappers issuing their best guesses about the eventual outcome they wrotethose exchanges prompted another voice to enter the conversation that of mark mellman a respected democratic pollster to whom many journalists long have gone for his insights into polls and elections noting that ornstein abramowitz cohen and blumenthal were all very smart people mellman sought to avoid taking sides and instead offered a few thoughts of his own on the issues raisedwriting in the hill mellman began by saying that an examination of polling averages of realclearpolitics and the huffington posts pollsters model showed that there is little doubt that the presidential race has tightened considerably since march and april but he added that the current state of the race does not necessarily mean the outcome in november will be closehe reminded everyone that in the spring of  when john mccain had wrapped up the republican nomination while barack obama was still engaged in a hard contest against clinton the generalelection polls showed the arizona senator ahead he lost the general election by percentage pointslooking at the issue of trumps support among hispanics in the nbcsurveymonkey poll he said that percent seems high but not bizarrely out of sync given other polls and history he also said that if trump were getting say percent of the hispanic vote rather than percent trumps overall number in the horse race would be just points lowerpolls have played a significant role in this campaign theyve determined participation in the gop debates and how the candidates were aligned on the stage and theyve driven a lot of coverage of the race there is no question that news organizations have sometimes been indiscriminate in the way they have highlighted individual pollsso there is food for thought in this series of exchanges the traditional method of polling has become prohibitively expensive for most organizations at a time when the demand for public opinion surveys continues to grow in politics and other fields the methodology of all types of polls is under challenge there is a serious and urgent debate underway among public opinion researchers about the way forwardfor the rest of us the exchanges lead to common points of agreement all of which might seem obvious but should not be forgotten dont put too much emphasis on any single poll look closely at averages of groups of polls to determine whether there are real shifts in the race and dont expect polls to predict the future leave that question to the voters in november',\n",

russian meddling  in the  election which saw donald trump elected as president of the united states the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory to date none has surfaced the intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original they ve been doing this for an awfully long time and we are decades into the russians trying to undermine american democracy  cia chief mike pompeo told msnbc s hugh hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired saturday june russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova has made a noteworthy response to pompeo s commentsvia russia insidertranslation we could not but take note of and comment on the june  statement by cia director mike pompeo during his nbc interview the statement dealt with russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the american democracy and meddling in the us elections it appears that in his opinion russia s longtime attempts to undermine the us democracy have culminated in the interference in us elections as we know the issue of russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the united states this story has been adopted by antirussia propagandists this issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to datewe would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of us history unlike the americans we have real facts at our disposal and we know what we should focus on it is common knowledge that since the early s the united states had voiced its intentions to establish a jeffersonian democracy in russia but the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of thomas jefferson one of the founding fathers of the american nation and democracy all of us know he called for respecting various forms of government chosen by other nations and said the united states would not impose its will anywhere he was mistaken thomas jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant brutal and outrageousit appears that the ideologists of the presentday america have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood if the concepts of  exporting democracy  and  humanitarian intervention  have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept for decades dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from usimposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern without any consideration for what makes each of them unique this policy and experiments cannot be called harmless in the past few years afghanistan iraq libya egypt syria and ukraine have fallen prey to this concept needless to say alqaeda in all its manifestations isis and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forcesgenerous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and ngos is another  grey zone  through which the united states has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years russia virtually tops the list of these allocations various government and nongovernment organizations including the peace corps the united states agency for international development usaid the national democratic institute the international republican institute and many other similar agencies have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion according to some sources the us has spent  billion dollars for these purposes in the s alone it is very strange that while making such statements mr pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency it is strange that washington forgets the fact that in the runup to the  russian presidential election the federal reserve bank delivered  million in cash to the us embassy in moscow under a farfetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old  notes operatives from the cia s moscow embassy station headed by michael sulick virtually slept on the money bags while guarding them foreignmade cars delivered small batches of money from the embassy to certain individualswho did the us sponsor using this money i believe we will also learn this someday i do not mean our assumptions everything is clear here  well will know the specific names dates and so on here are only a few examples of diverse us activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow american instructions we are in no way demanding that mr pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction one should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction we are ready read more russia news at st century wire russia filessupport our work by subscribing

       " 'america is criminalizing black teachers atlantas cheating scandal and the racist underbelly of education reform i am an educator i am a black woman who may someday mother a black child i have taught other black mothers children much of my educational success in elementary school is directly attributable to high performance on standardized tests that caused my white teachers to notice me and intervene on my behalf to get me tracked into higherachieving classrooms i believe all children deserve access to a good highquality publiceducationtherefore i dont have to condone cheating in any form and i dont to assert that what has happened in atlanta to these teachers is a travesty the pictures that emerged last week of handcuffed black schoolteachers being led out of southern courtrooms in one of the countrys largest urban black school systems were absolutely heartbreakingscapegoating black teachers for failing in a system that is designed for black children in particular not to succeed is the real corruption here since the early s we have watched the deprofessionalization of teaching achieved through the proliferation of teacher fellow programs and the massive conservativeled effort to defund public education in major urban areas throughout the country there is no longer a consensus that a good public education  a hallmark of american democracy  should be considered a public goodblack children have for generations been the primary victims of this continuing social mendacity about the national value of education more than  percent of children who attend public schools live in poverty in georgia the percentage of black children living in poverty hovers right around  percent for latino children the number is consistently over  percent nationally the number for black children is  percent according to most recent data and  percent for latino youtheighty percent of children in atlanta public schools are black eleven percent are white and  percent are latino however only  percent of children in atlantas gifted and talented programs are black whereas  percent are white more disturbingly  percent of all students expelled from atlanta public schools during the  academic school year were blackthese numbers taken together paint an abysmal picture of students who are disproportionately poor overdisciplined and systematically tracked out of highperforming classrooms and yet we expect teachers to work magic in conditions that are set up for failurelest you think this is merely an atlanta problem over at the crunk feminist collective susana morris tells a similar story of attending a predominantly black high school in florida with advanced classes that were overwhelmingly whiteher story mirrors my own in louisiana in the s and s students took two standardized tests one the leap test measured basic proficiency and the other the california achievement test measured more advanced proficiencies in the thirdgrade i scored  percent on the leap test the only student in my overwhelmingly white class to do so the teacher mrs callender called me up to the front of the room and bragged about me to all the other students that same year on the cat test i scored in the  percent percentilemeanwhile i noticed one day during class that several of my white classmates among them my best friend amanda were all mysteriously led out of class and then returned later with no explanation when i asked amanda where shed been she said school officials had made her take a test but she wasnt clear what for she never mentioned it againthe next year fourth grade i walked into a classroom and met beatrice gaulden one of only three black academic teachers i would ever have with her neon green and yellow hammerpants her penchant for drinking eight tall glasses of water a day and her strict instructions each morning  we were not to approach her desk but rather to wait until she moved to a stool in the front of the room for open discussion time  she was a wonder mrs gaulden is a character in most of my childhood stories of transformation because she was so pivotal to my own sense of selfworth as an outspoken bossy loquacious bespectacled ponytailed black girl in a predominantly white classroombecause of mrs gauldens instruction my test scores leaped from the th percentile to the th percentile within one year of instruction she never taught to the test she simply taughtthat year the louisiana gifted and talented program came calling for me as they had called for my friends the year before i took the battery of tests they offered no doubt because mrs gaulden had asked them to look at my case they came back to her she would tell me years later and told her that i had not passed the tests she implored them to rescore my assessment they came back to her and reported an error in their scoring as if and so i became a gifted and talented student with even smaller classes more specialized instruction early opportunities to take the act and sat and to travel i soared with the additional resources provided by the gt programbut my educational access was due to one magical black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it mrs gaulden nurtured taught and challenged all her students regardless of race but she saw in me a black girl who needed extra guidance and a little push and she willingly gave it over the past generation we have watched the gop helped along by an impotent democratic party systematically dismantle funding for public education underpay teachers and allow local school systems to institute punitive disciplinary measures that have turned our schools into a prison pipeline at exactly the same moment these reformers and their political counterparts george w bush no child left behind and barack obama race to the top have instituted highstakes testing tied to financial incentives for teachers as the solution to the structural risks overwhelmingly facing children of color meanwhile testcheating scandals have proliferated in locales across the country in other urban locales like baltimore houston and philadelphia principals and teachers were fired andor stripped of their licenses to teach this is a punishment that fits the crime then theres michelle rhee the famed former chancellor of dc public schools who was accused of creating the very same culture of fear about test scores that superintendent beverly hall has been accused of creating in atlanta hall was charged with racketeering so why was rhee not subject to prosecution when testscore irregularities emerged in the district bruce dixon was already asking as much two years ago over at black agenda report not only has rhee not been prosecuted but she maintains a fairly high level of bipartisan support from conservatives and political centrists for her views on education reform halls trial was indefinitely postponed last year due to stage iv breast cancer she died last month at  years old locking up black women under the guise of caring about black children is an unbelievable move in an educational environment that systematically denies both care and opportunity to black children locking up black women for racketeering when the system couldnt be bothered to lock up even one of the bankers who gave disproportionate amounts of terrible home loans to black women leading to a national economic crash and a disproportionate amount of home foreclosures among black women in  is patently unjust given that public schools are largely funded through property taxes and that black children are overwhelming reared by black single mothers the failure to vigorously prosecute the financial institutions and lenders that gutted black neighborhoods means that the system cosigned corporate acts of institutional violence against black mothers and children and against neighborhood schools in black communities but now we are expected to believe that prosecuting these teachers as racketeers is an act of justice nothing is just about making black women sacrificial lambs of an educational system hellbent on throwing black children away the images of their handcuffed black bodies being led in shame from the courtroom gives black parents angry about the miseducation of their children a convenient target for their angst and outrage over a failing system meanwhile the real racket  privatization and defunding of public schools diversion of taxpayer resources away from education and increasing political clout and payouts for school reformers proselytizing the false gospel of high stakes testing  gets obscured and white children still get educated well either in private schools or in suburban schools funded through a solid property tax base everything i am today i owe to my mother and to a black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it for so many exceptionally achieving black people a providential encounter with a black teacher is the singular thing that made the difference no other group of people systematically and structurally love and care about black children more than black mothers and black usually female teachers they have been the ones holding aloft the banner emblazoned with the revolutionary idea that black lives matter before it was ever a slogan upon which to build a movement an attack on black teachers is an attack on black children black families and black communities we should stand in solidarity with these teachers and these students and say not on our watch',\n",

       " 'travelers stranded and protests swell over trump order  the new york times washington     travelers were stranded around the world protests escalated in the united states and anxiety rose within president trumps party on sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration the white house pulled back on part of mr trumps temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the united states by the end of the day the department of homeland security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order but the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the presidents order as a retreat from traditional american values european leaders denounced the order and some republican lawmakers called on mr trump to back down as of sunday evening officials said no one was being held at american airports although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained more than any of the myriad moves mr trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building it has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order and into its broadest diplomatic incident with overseas allies objecting the white house was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process aides to mr trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials but the head of the customs and border service in the obama administration who resigned on inauguration day said the incoming presidents team never talked with him about it white house officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out only about  travelers were detained in the first  hours out of the   who typically enter the united states in a day they said as of sunday evening the department of homeland security said  green card holders had been granted waivers to enter that did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel reince priebus the white house chief of staff said mr trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with american lives were not willing to be wrong on this subject he said on face the nation on cbs president trump is not willing to take chances on this subject  the order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for  days and from syria indefinitely it blocks any visitors for  days from seven designated countries iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen the department of homeland security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the united states with thousands of protesters chanting outside his white house windows and thronging the streets of washington and other cities mr trump late on sunday defended his order to be clear this is not a muslim ban as the media is falsely reporting he said in a written statement this is not about religion     this is about terror and keeping our country safe  he noted that the seven countries were identified by former president barack obamas administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly muslim countries we will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next  days he said mr trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in syria i have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in syria he said my first priority will always be to protect and serve our country but as president i will find ways to help all those who are suffering  while mr trump denied that his action focused on religion the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all muslim visitors as late as sunday morning he made clear that his concern was for christian refugees and part of his order gives preferential treatment to christians who try to enter the united states from   nations in a twitter post on sunday morning mr trump deplored the killing of christians in the middle east without noting the killings of muslims who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in iraq syria and elsewhere christians in the middle east have been executed in large numbers he wrote we cannot allow this horror to continue his order however resulted in a second day of uncertainty at american airports the american civil liberties union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in new york boston seattle los angeles and chicago new yorks attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at kennedy international airport the department of homeland security said on sunday evening that it was in compliance with judicial orders  still at dulles international airport outside washington even the arrival of four democratic members of congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained the lawmakers arrived after  p m and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the customs and border protection offices at the airport representative gerry connolly democrat of virginia said he was told to call the main office of the agency in washington his staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone and they said well put you in touch with the deputy commissioner mr connolly said i said thats not acceptable he continued we want to talk to the person in charge of operations at dulles airport thats where the problem is and thats where the federal judicial ruling is applicable  the clash over the order provoked emotional responses at a news conference senator chuck schumer the democratic minority leader from new york choked up as he vowed to claw scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned  the mayors of new york chicago and boston spoke out as well in dallas mayor mike rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   worth airport we have wished them welcome and we have apologized from the depths of our heart he said chelsea clinton joined a protest in new york the order roiled relations with americas traditional allies in europe and the middle east the spokesman for chancellor angela merkel of germany said she is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief  prime minister theresa may of britain who met with mr trump in washington on friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him initially declined to comment on the policy on saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in turkey but under pressure from opposition politicians her spokesman later said the british government did not agree with this kind of approach  the matter was especially sensitive in muslim countries and mr trump spoke by telephone on sunday with king salman of saudi arabia and sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan the crown prince of abu dhabi white house statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order which did not include their countries in washington protesters gathered by the thousands outside mr trumps front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with muslim americans shame they chanted hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion where mr trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie finding dory  no hate no fear they added later refugees are welcome here  security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon when protesters departed to march to capitol hill some republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order this executive order sends a signal intended or not that america does not want muslims coming into our country senators john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina said in a statement that is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security  some conservative donors also criticized the decision officials with the political network overseen by charles g and david h koch the billionaire conservative activists released a statement on sunday criticizing mr trumps handling of the issue we believe it is possible to keep americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families said brian hooks a chairman of the kochs donor network the travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive  senator bob corker the chairman of the foreign relations committee said the order was poorly implemented and urged the president to make appropriate revisions  other republicans were more circumspect senator mitch mcconnell the republican majority leader said the issue would be decided by the courts mr trump fired back at mr mccain and mr graham on twitter they are sadly weak on immigration he wrote senators should focus their energies on isis illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start world war iii ',\n",

presidential commission formed to investigate alleged voter fraud  trump has relied heavily on unilateral executive actions to advance his policy objectives his fellow republicans who control congress have been unable to pass any major legislation he has sought  executive actions can be challenged in court more quickly than lengthy federal rulemaking procedures said law professor jonathan adler of case western reserve university school of law  obama relied on executive actions during the later years of his presidency after being unable to win congressional approval of key initiatives and some of those actions drew legal challenges but early in his presidency he relied on unilateral actions less often because his fellow democrats controlled congress and passed major legislation including the  obamacare law  some legal experts say the haste with which trump drafted some of his policy initiatives may have helped those challenging the actions because the orders were not sufficiently vetted  this administration is more willing to shoot from the hip when compared with the obama administration adler said  that is how san francisco city attorney dennis herrera a democrat saw trumpsexecutive order on sanctuary city funding which herrera calculated could jeopardize up to  billion in federal funds for his city  herrera said he saw trumps action as designed to appeal to a part of the administrations political base without really having been vetted by lawyers to ensure it was legally airtight herrera won an initial ruling in april blocking the measure and the case is now pending before an appeals court  trumps actions have appealed to his conservative political base while the legal challenges have pleased his liberal critics  speaking at an event at new york university schneiderman new yorks attorney general called trumps first travel ban signed in january just a week into his presidency a galvanizing moment for democratic officials  while lawsuits challenging the presidents actions have won some important early victoriesthe litigation onslaughts ultimate effect on trumps agenda is not yet clear  trumps opponents have tended to file suits in jurisdictions where they think they are likely to prevail and where appeals will be heard in regional federal circuit courts dominated by democraticappointed judges  the final decisions on the cases

       " 'melting glaciers in bolivian andes leave communities at risk posted on october   by edmondo burr in scienvironment   comments glaciers of the bolivian andes receded by  between  and  according to the findings of a new study rising temperatures in the andes have left people living at high altitudes with a water crisis the study was published in the cryosphere  an european geosciences union journal recommended the rapid melting of one the largest glaciers on earth the totten glacier in east antarctica could raise global sea level at least  meters by the end of the century according to a new study  hours ago  on top of that glacier recession is leaving lakes that could burst and wash away villages or infrastructure downstream  says leadauthor simon cook  a lecturer at the manchester metropolitan university in the uk european geosciences union reports receding glaciers also put water supply in the region at risk glacial meltwater is important for irrigation drinking water and hydropower both for mountain villages and large cities such as la paz and el alto throughout the year the  million inhabitants of these two cities receive about  of their water supply from glaciers  with this percentage almost doubling during the dry season glacier retreat also means less water is available to supply rivers and lakes such as southern bolivias lake poop which recently dried up  the new study is one of the first to monitor recent largescale glacier change in bolivia to better understand how receding glaciers could affect communities in the country the novelty of our study lies in the bigger picture  measuring glacier change over all main glaciated ranges in bolivia  and in the identification of potentially dangerous lakes for the first time cook says the team measured glacier area change from  to  using satellite images from landsat the us geological surveys and nasas earth observation programme they found that the area of the bolivian andes covered by glaciers decreased from about  square kilometres in  to only around  square kilometres in  a reduction of  recommended bodies of climbers alex lowe  david bridges found in melting glacier the remains of renowned american mountain climber alex lowe and his companion cameraman david bridges have been found partially melting out of a glacier on shishapangma tibet the two climbers disappeared in a himalayan avalanche  years ago while attempting to ascend the th highest mountain in the world  hours ago as glaciers recede they leave behind lakes typically dammed by bedrock or glacial debris avalanches rockfalls or earthquakes can breach these dams or cause water to overflow them resulting in catastrophic floods known as glacial lake outburst floods the team reports that both the number and size of glacier lakes in the study region increased significantly from  to  after studying glacier change the researchers used their  glaciallake observations to identify the lakes where outburst floods could occur and present a hazard to populations we mapped hundreds of lakes cook explains some lakes are very small and pose little risk others are very large but theres little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically others are both large enough to create a big flood and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers and could be dangerous they identified  glacial lakes across the bolivian andes as potentially dangerous to communities and infrastructure as they could result in very damaging floods if the smallest of these  lakes was to drain completely it would yield a flood with a peak discharge of  cubic metres per second the largest could result in a discharge of over  cubic metres of water about  times the volume of an olympic swimming pool in a second while measuring glacier area change was a relatively simple task cook says identifying which lakes are dangerous is the million dollar question as there are various factors to take into account we considered that a lake was dangerous if there were settlements or infrastructure downvalley from the lake and if the slopes and glaciers around the lake were very steep meaning that they could shed ice or snow or rock into the lake which would cause it to overtop and generate a flood  a bit like jumping into a swimming pool but on a much bigger scale recommended a new study on antidepressants published in the bmj has revealed that the risk of suicide and aggression in children and teens increases twofold when they are prescribed drugs to treat depression  hours ago such catastrophic floods have occurred in the region in the past dirk hoffmann a researcher at the bolivian mountain institute and coauthor in the cryosphere study recently documented a glacial lake outburst flood in the apolobamba region that happened in  and killed farm animals destroyed cultivated fields and washed away a road that left a village isolated for months as those locations are very remote and far away from the cities authorities at national level and the wider public are often not even aware of the new dangers that mountain dwellers are facing due to the impacts of climate change and no appropriate measures are being taken hoffmann says cook says these events could be underreported suggesting the risk of such floods in the bolivian andes has been overlooked we heard of other glacier lake outburst flood events from villagers when we visited the apolobamba region in  but there is no mention of these in publications or papers possibly because many of these communities are relatively remote hoffmann adds a nationwide risk assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes would be of great interest to local communities in glacier watersheds in the study the team also estimated that glacier area will be severely reduced by the end of the century to about a tenth of the  values this would put communities even more at risk from water scarcity cook says we predicted in our study that most glaciers will be gone or much diminished by the end of the century  so where will the water come from in the dry season big cities like la paz are partially dependent on meltwater from glaciers but little is known about potential water resource stress in more remote areas more work needs to be done on this issue the team hope the study raises awareness about the rapid glacier loss in bolivia how it could change in the future and how it could affect water supply and cause glacial lake outburst floods ultimately i hope that our results will be useful to people in bolivia  governments agencies people living in rural areas and cities cook concludes this research is presented in the paper glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the bolivian andes to appear in the egu open access journal the cryosphere on  october ',\n",

 traditional sangkya is an eggy custard with a strong coconut flavor most recipes call for quite a bit of sugar so this recipe is a loosely adapted interpretation of the original its much healthier completely vegan and is a great alternative to flourbased holiday treats this seasonal dessert does need to chill for several hours before serving so plan ahead the coconut yogurt and soaked cashew

you want a less tart or more coconutty flavor kabocha or japanese pumpkin is the best choice for this recipe similar to butternut squash the kabocha has fewer calories and many people say it tastes better its a great source of betacarotene iron vitamin c  and fiber you can substitute pie pumpkins if you have trouble finding kabocha when selecting your kabocha squash choose a squat wide shape over a taller round one this will give the top of the custard a better chance to brown while baking you can also skip the pumpkin entirely if youre just looking for a vegan baked custard recipe if you choose this route make sure to bake the custard for only twenty minutes one item to note this recipe makes enough custard to fill a pumpkin with a  in  cm circumference if youre using a smaller pumpkin you may want to halve this recipe i recommend keeping a small  springform pan ready for any leftover custard just bake it along with your pumpkin for twenty minutes and allow to cool how did pumpkins get to japan if you thought pumpkin and squash came from the americas you are absolutely correct portuguese traders and explorers originally brought squash and pumpkins from brazil to japan in the th century    while the portuguese empire was expanding into south asia the kabocha squash is simply a variety of cucurbita maxima the same species that produces the gigantic pumpkins that win ribbons at state fairs i dont recommend you try to make this recipe with one of those monsters though it could feed an army but the cooking time would take days their smaller japanese cousins however do quite nicely in japan the squash is called kuri kabocha  or nutty pumpkin    if youve ever tasted kabocha youll understand the nutty moniker the texture is fluffy and reminiscent of chestnuts but the flavor is sweet like a butternut squash crossed with a sweet potato kabocha squash have dark forestgreen skin a slightly squished or flattened shape and brilliant orange flesh    you can actually

       " 'donald trump agrees to pay  million in trump university settlement  the new york times donald j trump has reversed course and agreed on friday to pay  million to settle a series of lawsuits stemming from his defunct   education venture trump university finally putting to rest fraud allegations by former students which have dogged him for years and hampered his presidential campaign the settlement was announced by the new york attorney general just  days before one of the cases a federal   lawsuit in san diego was set to be heard by a jury the deal averts a potentially embarrassing and highly unusual predicament a   on trial and possibly even taking the stand in his own defense while scrambling to build his incoming administration it was a remarkable concession from a real estate mogul who derides legal settlements and has mocked fellow businessmen who agree to them but the allegations in the case were highly unpleasant for mr trump students paid up to   in tuition for a programs that according to the testimony of former trump university employees used   sales tactics and employed unqualified instructors the agreement wraps together the outstanding trump university litigation including two federal   cases in san diego and a separate lawsuit by eric t schneiderman the new york attorney general the complaints alleged that students were cheated out of thousands of dollars in tuition through deceptive claims about what they would learn and   sales tactics i am pleased that under the terms of this settlement every victim will receive restitution and that donald trump will pay up to  million in penalties to the state of new york for violating state education laws mr schneiderman said in a statement the victims of trump university have waited years for todays result and i am pleased that their patience     and persistence     will be rewarded by this  million settlement  the settlement is a significant reversal from mr trump who had steadfastly rejected the allegations and vowed to fight the lawsuits asserting that students filled out evaluations showing they were mostly happy with what they had learned in seminars when political opponents pressed him on the claims during the campaign mr trump doubled down saying he would eventually reopen trump university its something i could have settled many times mr trump said during a debate in february i could settle it right now for very little money but i dont want to do it out of principle  he added the people that took the course all signed     most     many     many signed report cards saying it was fantastic it was wonderful it was beautiful  but the position of mr trump and his legal team appeared to soften soon after his election victory on nov  at a hearing last week daniel petrocelli a lawyer for mr trump expressed interest in moving toward a settlement meanwhile mr trumps lawyers were seeking to delay the trial in one of the california cases until after his inauguration on jan  while also requesting that he be allowed to testify on video at a hearing on the case in san diego on friday mr petrocelli said mr trump had settled the case without an acknowledgment of fault or liability  the judge overseeing the two california cases gonzalo curiel was thrust into the limelight of the campaign in may when mr trump spent several minutes at a rally denouncing the judges decisions in the case calling him a hater and questioning his impartiality because of his mexican heritage after he faced days of criticism for his remarks on the judge mr trump released a statement saying his words had been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of mexican heritage  he also asserted that he was justified in questioning the fairness of his trial given various rulings in the case that went against him still he concluded we will win this case judge curiel said in court friday that he hoped that the settlement agreement     and the end of the presidential campaign     would begin a healing process that this country very sorely needs  under the agreement mr trump will pay  million to settle the two california   suits and  million to settle with the new york attorney general the lawyers for the plaintiffs waived their attorneys fees the deal still has to be approved in court which could take months about   students will share in the settlement according to their lawyers the customers will be eligible to recoup at least half of what they spent at trump university and some could receive a full refund the lawyers said even before he was in the throes of his presidential bid mr trump began mounting a vigorous public defense of himself and trump university a website percentapproval com touted high marks it received from students a new york times report in march though showed how some students recalled being pressured to give positive reviews trump university which operated from  to  included free introductory seminars across the country focusing largely on real estate investing and learning mr trumps secrets students could then purchase more expensive packages costing up to   documents made public through the litigation revealed that some former trump university managers had given testimony about its unscrupulous and exploitative business practices one sales executive testified that the operation was a facade a total lie  another manager called it a fraudulent scheme  other records showed how mr trump had overstated the depth of his involvement in the programs despite claims that mr trump had handpicked instructors he acknowledged in testimony that he had not in addition to the financial rewards the conclusion of the trump university cases brings vindication to former students mostly ordinary people across the country who felt they had been robbed of their savings by mr trump a successful businessman they respected and admired one student jeffrey tufenkian who enrolled with his wife to pursue a real estate career told the new york times in  that the experience was almost completely worthless  trump university has no interest in taking care of its customers said mr tufenkian who paid   for a gold elite class which he said at the time wiped out much of his savings alan garten a lawyer for mr trump said friday that his side was pleased with the settlement while we have no doubt that trump university would have prevailed at trial based on the merits of this case resolution of these matters allows   trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation he said in a statement',\n",

did in other words many americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise we should believe mainstream media well here we are in october of  and finally though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone no longer can it be considered a conspiracy by anyone that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite that said now it is time to confront the fully engineered and longplanned ending of this  us presidential election will staged  political terrorism  a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the american psyche be staged as mike adams at natural news is writing about  will this terrorism or planned event mark the beginning of the end of america if so what will happen how will it all go down many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy america the one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many events of the past several years have been scripted and planned so today i invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in todays events the fact that they are planned the notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate they hate anything that is organic spontaneous unpredictable peoplepowered natural and real they need everything to be controlled scripted planned orchestrated engineered do you see a pattern here one consciousness longs for freedom naturalness and spontaneity the other longs to control orchestrate engineer and dictate the ending like a master would want to control his slave understanding this fundamental contrast between the controlfreak consciousness think ruling elite and the freespirited consciousness will allow you to see whats coming this november th  whats coming is a longawaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of so the real question is will their operation succeed looking at the election day ending from a birdseye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan theyll need based on the materializing reality at that moment in this what ill call waitandsee plan whose execution will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reactionbased plan to be determined by the emerging reality we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan in other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking this ultimately is all we need to know to plan our truth seekers and freedom lovers next move and our next move should look something like this if you ask me  have a plan including options for selfsustaining yourself and your loved ones food water shelter and other personal needs  expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators lets not let one of these traitors including crisis actors and operatives working for the state get away with what they have done  dont rely only on the internet to keep track of developing events you might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents proof also download important videos dont assume these videos will always be available on youtube or the internet remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age the main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed america and humanity  beware of layered psychological operations question everything you hear and dont discount that some news is designed for you to hear it get it unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the ante when it comes to the information war in deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are especially as we see the hillarymainstream media complex laughably blaming russian president vladimir putin for all the nowrevealed corruption and criminality of the clintons the mainstream media the dnc and many others now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies lightness versus darkness freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge the occult because this my friends is what we are dealing with we truth seekers are all in this together we didnt ask to be put in this show it sort of came to us perhaps we awakened humanity are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand this species we call humans needs some members of its kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity there is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted we like them will also respond in realtime in the most effective way possible what we need to do more than anything else is  pay attention  think ahead just like they do and so today im thinking ahead i have plans for both scenarios trump or hillary declared victory i have plans for no political terrorism and political terrorism shock or no shock chaos or no chaos in my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption plain and simple the ruling elite must be identified stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the us constitution this is more important than any presidential election will a trump victory make this accountability more possible many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us finally im reminded of the very last line of the film the american dream when the villain asks what do you think this is and the answer this is america likewise lets remember this is america the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the us constitution will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way that question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night this is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and

the main issues he has confronted and what he has achieved ahead of saturdays th day  a pledge to repeal and replace the  affordable care act president barack obamas signature domestic policy was among trumps central  election campaign promises it is also one of the biggest failures of his first  days  a bill in the house of representatives was withdrawn in late march when republicans could not muster enough votes for passage even though they control the chamber  a reworked plan this week has drawn support from the house freedom caucus the conservative bloc that helped sink the original bill that improves the chances of a deal in the house though it is unclear if it can win enough support from moderate republicans and it would face tougher challenges in the senate   trump repeatedly promised the biggest tax reform since the s this week he proposed legislation to slash the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent cut the top personal income tax rate to  percent repeal the inheritance tax and temporarily slash the rate on overseas profits repatriated to the united states the plan however is vague and even senior republican lawmakers described it as offering only guideposts for legislative changes  trumps foreign policy has been marked by major shifts russia trump spoke admiringly of russian president vladimir putin during the campaign and indicated he wanted a rapprochement with moscow but the administration has not been able to fend off a controversy that has led to a congressional investigation into russian meddling in the  election including possible links between trumps campaign and moscow trumphas cooled considerably toward putin putin condemned trumps decision in early april to launch cruise missile strikes on syria in punishment for a chemical weapons attack by the syrian government and trump said the relationship with russia may be at an alltime low  north korea a growing nuclear and missile threat from north korea is perhaps trumps most serious security challenge he has vowed to prevent north korea from being able to hit the united states with a nuclear missile a capability experts say pyongyang could have some time after  trumps administration aims to push north korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure he has pressed china north koreas biggest trading partner to do more to curb pyongyangs nuclear program  nato trump alarmed us allies during the election campaign by calling nato obsolete in midapril he lavished praise on nato and said it is not obsolete  syria trump had vowed to avoid entanglements in middle east conflicts and in his first days in office said he did not want the united states dragged deeper into the syrian conflict but he responded to the chemical weapons attack which killed dozens of people by ordering strikes on a syrian air base that won praise from allies in europe and from us lawmakers  trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigrants entering the united states and the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the country especially those with criminal records he also pledged to build a wall along the border and to get mexico to pay for it  the approach and strong rhetoric have had an effect with the number of migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally hitting a year low in march the number of children traveling with a guardian and apprehended at the southern us border plunged by more than  percent in march from december trump insists he will build the border wall but in order to lift the threat of a government shutdown he gave way on his demand this week that congress include full funding for it in a spending bill  trump campaigned on a promise to bar the entry of muslims into the united states casting it as part of the fight against the islamic state militant group on jan  he ordered a temporary ban on the entry of nationals from seven muslimmajority countries including syria he also indefinitely banned refugees from syria and temporarily banned refugees from all other countries a federal judge temporarily halted the ban and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling trump issued a revised travel ban in early march only to see it again blocked in federal court similarly a federal judge this week blocked his order to withhold federal funding from socalled sanctuary cities which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants  this is one of trumps clearest wins his promise to select a likeminded successor to justice antonin scalia who died early last year was kept with the nomination of neil gorsuch the senate confirmed gorsuch despite democratic opposition restoring a conservative majority on the court  trump withdrew the united states from the transpacific partnership trade deal just days after his inauguration keeping a campaign promise trump had both threatened to withdraw from or renegotiate the north american free trade agreement nafta blaming it for an exodus of us jobs to mexico the threats of withdrawal had jolted financial markets at various times on thursday trump extended an olive branch saying he would not terminate nafta after the leaders of mexico and canada asked him to work on a new trade deal  trump also ordered a review of the causes of us trade deficits such as dumping of products below cost unfair subsidies misaligned currencies and nonreciprocal trade practices  trump had vowed to name china a currency manipulator meaning the united states could then impose tariffs on chinese goods but in midapril he changed course and said that china was not a currency manipulator trump has acted aggressively on his promise to eliminate regulations that he said were hurting the us economy he issued a permit for the controversial keystone xl pipeline he also rescinded obamaera climate change regulations including the clean power plan a ban on coal leasing on federal lands and rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production  as part of a push to open up more federal lands to drilling mining and other development trump ordered a review to identify national monuments that can be rescinded or resized legal challenges are expected  his administration has approved a dozen measures rolling back regulations passed in the final months of the obama administration on the environment energy education and financial services trump has pledged to keep us companies from shipping jobs overseas before taking office trump used the muscle of his election victory to threaten companies about moving jobs abroad he claimed victories with the carrier unit of united technologies corp utxn and with ford motor co fn though carrier still cut hundreds of jobs in indiana and ford said it scrapped plans for a mexican factory because of declining demand for small cars in north america the jury is still out on how successful he can be in keeping jobs from going overseas trump ordered a review of the hb visa program which brings highly skilled foreign workers into the united states he says he wants to modify or replace the current lottery system with a meritbased system for highly skilled workers  this was one of trumps rallying cries during the campaign saying he would change washington by cracking down on the influence of special interests and political elites he criticized democratic opponent hillary clinton for her paid speeches to wall street bank goldman sachs but has named several former goldman executives to his inner circle he did ban appointees of any executive

known as mad dog and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan to lead the pentagon we are going to appoint mad dog mattis as our secretary of defense trump told a rally in cincinnati he said the formal announcement would be made on monday the choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that trump a republican intends to steer us foreign policy away from democratic president barack obamas increased reliance on us allies to fight islamist militants and to help deter russian and chinese aggression in europe and asia mattis is a revered figure in the marine corps and known for his distrust of iran the washington post and cnn reported earlier that trump had chosen mattis but trump spokesman jason miller said earlier on twitter that no decision has been made yet with regard to secretary of defense while the nomination of the yearold mattis would likely be popular among us forces it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle   because he retired only in  mattis would need the us congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the pentagon his impressive combat record however may deter some senate democrats from trying to block his nomination trump has described mattis as a true generals general  the new york real estate magnate famously asserted last year i know more about isis than the generals do mattis whose past assignments include leading central command which oversees us military operations in the middle east and south asia is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the us armed forces fighting wars in one famous line in  attributed to mattis the general told marines in iraq be polite be professional but have a plan to kill everybody you meet in a  questionandanswer session mattis appeared to be moved by a marines question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand known as a killcasualty radius once you get to be a highranking officer the killcasualty radius is whatever your marines make it and by the time i got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles he said in a video for the marine corps still such tough talk has gotten him in hot water he was once rebuked for saying in  that its fun to shoot some people  his talk however belies a more thoughtful side mattis once said the most important  inches in a combat zone was between your ears now a fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution mattis is also a scholar who was praised by thenus defense secretary robert gates in  as one of the countrys great strategic thinkers  mattis reads avidly frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television  after meeting mattis on nov  trump described him as a strong dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someones face to simulate drowning  trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under president barack obama but bring back a hell of a lot worse if elected  mattis said ive always found give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with torture and i was very impressed by that answer trump told the new york times the senate armed services committee will consider mattis nomination in a statement on thursday night its chairman republican john mccain called him one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader  mattis would be the first former us general to become defense secretary since george c marshall took the job in  the decision adds to trumps national security team another pentagon veteran who served during the obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it officials who knew him before he retired in  said mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed central command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from iran and to win more resources for afghanistan trump has given the job of national security adviser to michael flynn a retired threestar army general who was pushed out of the top job at the defense intelligence agency in  by obamas administration  flynn was fiercely critical of obama during the  campaign adopting much of trumps rhetoric along with flynn and trumps choice for cia director us representative mike pompeo mattis has been critical of the deal to curb irans suspected nuclear weapons program saying the threat from tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about islamic state or al qaeda the iranian regime in my mind is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the middle east mattis said speaking about the iranian nuclear deal mattis said hoping that iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible modern nation is a bridge too far if mattis wins senate confirmation he will work side by side with another marine  general joseph dunford who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  having two marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite us fighting force it would also raise questions about how mattis and dunford might divide up tasks  both dunford and mattis share battlefield experience including in iraq in  mattis led the st marine division during the usled invasion of iraq he has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of falluja in  something he feared would hurt morale but did not we just dont take refuge in selfpity or any of that kind of stuff and so as a result the marine corps remains a very feared organization in this world as it should be he said ',\n",

in new york with the prime minister of japan shinzo abe as he continued his fitful adjustment to the protocols of   diplomacy i am convinced mr trump is a leader in whom i can have great confidence mr abe said after the meeting at trump tower he described the   encounter as really cordial  the visit with mr abe came after  congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders in the nine days since mr trump won the election none seem to have adhered to established diplomatic practice in which the state department choreographs the sequence of the calls and provides policy guidance and translating services on thursday night the state department said it was finally in contact with mr trumps emissaries but until now they had not requested any briefings nor had the  s calls     including with president vladimir v putin of russia and other adversaries of the united states     been routed through the state department as is customary according to a department official mr trumps aides did not respond to questions about whether the   had used his own interpreter in the meeting with mr abe and calls with other leaders or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them the order that the calls are done in seems like a silly protocol issue but its one that people really think about said loren dejonge schulman a senior fellow at the center for a new american security and a former top aide to the national security adviser susan e rice they are taking messages away from that whether you think its important or not  mr abes visit     mr trumps first with a foreign leader since the election     came on a day when the   was steeped in foreign policy he met with former secretary of state henry a kissinger to discuss events and issues around the world ranging from russia and china to iran and the european union according to the transition team he met with ron dermer israels ambassador to the united states who told reporters afterward that israel has no doubt that   trump is a true friend of israel  mr dermer said he looked forward to working with all of the members of the trump administration including stephen k bannon mr trumps chief strategist who has been accused of promoting   through his   news media operation breitbart news he met adm michael s rogers the director of the national security agency and the top officer at the militarys cyber command which gave him his first   exposure to the governments surveillance abilities and he met with gen jack keane a former army vice chief of staff who has been a longtime informal adviser to hillary clinton and a mentor to gen david h petraeus as well as a prime architect of the iraq troop surge in the george w bush administration i was impressed frankly for a couple of reasons general keane said in a telephone interview one by how personable he is and two by his intellectual curiosity about national security events most presidential candidates dont have an   knowledge of national security issues but he asked excellent questions  general keane declined to discuss the advice he had given mr trump but he said the new presidents greatest challenge would be to maintain americas leadership in a world in which radical islamic militancy was threatening to metastasize into a global jihadist movement and hostile powers like russia china and iran were seeking regional dominance during the campaign mr trump called into question the network of security alliances that the united states had maintained since world war ii saying the countrys partners in europe and asia were not paying their fair share for the american umbrella of protection few allies were as rattled by mr trumps campaign statements as japan at one point he suggested that japan and south korea consider acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves in the days leading to thursdays meeting officials from the japanese foreign and trade ministries were urging mr abe to take a tough line with mr trump on the value of the   partnership     a huge trade deal that mr trump opposes     and the countries defense alliance which mr trump has said japan must contribute more money toward according to michael j green a former official in the bush administration with close ties to japan but mr abe appeared to reject that advice preferring to focus on cultivating a personal relationship with mr trump some japan experts speculated that mr abe was concerned about getting off on the right foot with mr trump because when the japanese leader traveled to new york in september for the united nations general assembly meeting he met with mrs clinton who was then the favorite in the presidential race but not mr trump the japanese prime minister has done very well with strongmen like modi and putin said mr green referring to prime minister narendra modi of india and the russian president the question the japanese side still cannot understand is what a trump administration will actually do on asia mr green added dispelling such confusion is one reason for the choreographed nature of the first calls made to leaders in  mr obamas transition team had a plan for the   on the morning of election day ms rice who later became mr obamas ambassador to the united nations described the plan in an email to two of his other advisers in anticipation of the many calls from foreign leaders we have prepared a list

       " 'red alert the war on alternative media has begun print email httphumansarefreecomredalertwaronalternativemediahashtml reports about facebooks and googles nascent battle against purported fake news must be considered in solemn gravity  not because there are bogus articles circulating  but because in actuality it constitutes a war on legitimate factual information and dissenting opinion certainly many of us grumble when an article about aliens invading new york city passes through our newsfeeds only to be taken seriously  but the socalled problem of fake news facebooks mark zuckerberg is referring to isnt targeting such vapid content what facebook will target however should concern all of us after the absurdity that was the  presidential election hillary clinton supporters and establishment democrats excoriated zuckerberg for dereliction of duty in failing to remove sham news articles and sites from his wildly popular platform  because in their eyes this putative fake news literally swung the election toward donald trump but this seemingly hapless campaign of fingerpointing  the clinton camp also railed against fbi director james comey among many others in their search to blame anyone but themselves  has nothing at all to do with inane articles of no worth rather the new war on fake news is simply a poorlydisguised attempt to quash legitimate information unfavorable to the liberal establishments agenda  for good this perilous course of blanketing statesponsored censorship marks what might be the most overarching effort to kill dissenting opinion in decades  perhaps approaching or exceeding the height of the red scare and mccarthyism heres why mark zuckerberg a known proponent of establishment narrative and supporter of liberal goals originally responded to this criticism somewhat rationally saying the actual percentage of imposter news items is so miniscule it could not possibly have affected the outcome of the election hes right or at least he was of all the content on facebook more than  percent of what people see is authentic only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes the facebook head wrote in a post to his site on saturday the hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view or even to politics overall this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other after the failed clinton campaign turned and targeted zuckerberg and facebook with its bitter wrath of loss he abruptly switched his tune  and a plan is now underway for how to cope with this fake news non problem its imperative to consider several points concerning facebooks burgeoning war  with over one billion users worldwide no staff would be large enough to combat reports of fraudulent news that will undoubtedly be rolling in soon so the plan artificial intelligence  a selfteaching algorithm to identify and remove the supposedly counterfeit news items and likely relegate the source as a scarlet letter verboten site but an issue of grave concern has already arisen before the war on fake news even gets off the ground business insider boasted in a headline it took only  hours for these students to solve facebooks fakenews problem but theres a serious problem their algorithm failed miserably in fact one of the two items touted by business insider as proof of the success of the spurious newsslaying algorithm can be proven factually true  nearly verbatim  on the governments own website according to business insider the four students from various top universities participated in a recent hackathon at princeton university  which facebook cosponsored  in a mere  hours they created an extension for the chrome browser to ostensibly identify and parse out whether suspicious items constitute legitimate truthful news called  fib stop living a lie  it classifies every post be it pictures twitter snapshots adult content pictures fake links malware links fake news links as verified or nonverified using artificial intelligence one of the students told the outlet for links we take into account the websites reputation also query it against malware and phishing websites database and also take the content search it on googlebing retrieve searches with high confidence and summarize that link and show to the user for pictures like twitter snapshots we convert the image to text use the usernames mentioned in the tweet to get all tweets of the user and check if current tweet was ever posted by the user appearing smug in the articles lead picture nabanita de a secondyear masters student in computer science student at umass amherst anant goel a freshmen in purdue university mark craft a sophomore at university of illinois at urbanachampaign and catherine craft a sophomore also at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign all believe theyve discovered the quick fix to zuckerbergs now problem as an example the extension identified and marked an article not verified but the article a report touting findings from the national cancer institute which appeared on the governments national institute on drug abuse site marijuana kills cancer cells admits the us national cancer institute isnt fake at all from the governments site  with emphasis added nihfunded and other researchers are continuing to explore the possible uses of thc cbd and other cannabinoids for medical treatment for instance recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others  evidence from one cell culture study suggests that purified extracts from wholeplant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumors research in mice showed that treatment with purified extracts of thc and cbd  when used with radiation increased the cancerkilling effects of the radiation beyond this one example and much further to the point the democratic establishment is leading the call to abolish fake news  a blaring alarm bell for anyone paying attention this election cycle a trove of published leaked emails and documents by wikileaks concerning the democratic national committee campaign chair john podesta and hillary clinton  proved a staggering degree of corruption and collusion undertaken for years by establishment insiders and corporate media which for all intents and purposes amounted to an attempt to throw the election in their favor as the campaign came under heavy fire from all sides clintonites were quick to shift blame and try to discredit the mountainous evidence of wrongdoing  first by blaming wikileaks for trying to throw the election then by claiming the information being published was fake except it wasnt for nearly the entire duration of its existence wikileaks has offered a prize of several hundred thousand dollars for anyone who can prove even a single document it published isnt authentic  and that bounty though challenged from time to time remains unclaimed and now the outgoing democratic party wants to initiate a war on fake news nothing to see here folks everyone has the right to say what they want have access to sites that they want share what they want obama and democrat party insider  teddy goff told politico  which incidentally starred in several damning emails for colluding with the clinton campaign but a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on google and the equivalent ought to be the case on facebook  two three weeks ago many of us are beginning to talk about what a big problem this is both from the campaign and from the administration and just sort of broader obama orbit and are talking about this is one of the things we would like to take on postelection this is something we were very aware of saw zero percent chance facebook was going to be compliant or work with us during the election but wanted to take on postelection recall the aforementioned and justifiable doubt zuckerberg originally expressed about the nonexistent problem of fake news  and consider goff told politico these ostensibly false news items posted to facebook painted clinton as corrupt criminal or otherwise beyond the political pale in fact evidence of corruption media collusion and highly questionable if not explicitly criminal activity now mar hillary clintons legacy as secretary of state and  democratic nominee  not because of bogus reporting there was no need for fake items and  although a few websites certainly blew points out of proportion  the emails themselves damned clintons campaign thus the liberal establishments war on fake news  for which the head of the largest social media platform has now been roped in  amounts to little more than a witch hunt to silence truthful but damaging information information vital to the american public imperative for making informed choices and indispensable if this nation is still to be characterized as maintaining even a shred of freedom employing failed algorithms  or even people  is a hopelessly flawed solution to a problem that simply doesnt exist and what will result is a war on alternative independent media and opposing thought  in all forms considering the insidious wholly onesided nature of this plan it would be errant not to draw parallels to a new mccarthyism indeed independent media websites likely did help turn the election away from hillary clinton  not by posting inane false garbage or slanted reporting  but by having the integrity to post the truth about her dealings behind the scenes and where corporate media failed in journalistic integrity and due diligence alternative sources  led by wikileaks  excelled had the same vault of information surfaced about trump alternative media would have had the same field day  and thats where the clintonites have it all wrong fake news  dissenting opinion opposing viewpoints a free press  none of that tilted the election unless of course by fake news they are referring to corporate medias submitting articles to the clinton campaign prior to editors or hillary insiders collaborating on articles so ensure the right angle was employed  or any of the examples proven in leaked documents nominating hillary when a veritable revolution erupted behind bernie sanders however did it would behoove them to turn tail learn the lesson and walk away instead of imposing a blanketing and unnecessary campaign of censorship against fake news when the truth is a bitter pill to swallow meanwhile the mainstream media has been caught faking news countless times which had serious consequences worldwide',\n",

       " 'colorado weighs replacing obamas health policy with universal coverage  the new york times denver     for years voters in this swing state have rejected tax increases and efforts to expand government but now they are flirting with a radical transformation whether to abandon president obamas health care policy and instead create a new   public health system that guarantees coverage for everyone the estimated     proposal which will go before colorado voters in november will test whether people have an appetite for a new system that goes further than the affordable care act that question is also in play in the democratic presidential primaries the   effort which supporters here call the coloradocare plan would do away with deductibles it would allow patients to choose doctors and specialists without distinguishing between those in network and those out of network  it would largely be paid for with a tax increase on workers and businesses and cover everyone in the state supporters say most people would end up saving money insurance groups chambers of commerce and conservatives have already lined up in opposition they say the plans details are vague its size and cost galling the proposed health system would have a budget bigger than that of colorados entire state government a new  percent tax on payroll and incomes to pay for the system would push colorados tax rates to some of the highest in the nation the proposals chance of success is dubious colorado has a mixed record when it comes to ballot measures though it has passed some notable ones over the years including marijuana legalization and the taxpayer bill of rights an     constitutional amendment but the proposal had enough support to garner   signatures which put it on the ballot it has also worried insurers and some in the medical community and the business community enough for them to organize in opposition even enlisting a democratic former governor to help in their campaign in this season of political discontent the notion of dismantling the health insurance system has tapped an aquifer of frustration from voters people say that even after the affordable care act they still pay too much in premiums plus thousands in deductibles and still have to worry about being bankrupted by a disabling car crash or an extended hospital stay i think insurance is one of the biggest jokes and crooks said brandon barta  of denver he said his father dixon who worked at a gas station never received aggressive enough treatment for his prostate cancer he died last may at the age of  he was overlooked mr barta said mr barta said he was intrigued by the idea of a universal health plan that covered maternity care checkups emergency room visits and hospital stays all the way through    care like millions of americans he has health insurance tied to his work his coverage lapsed recently when he switched jobs to start working for a golf entertainment complex and he is still waiting for his new plan to kick in still he has questions about how universal coverage would work and how much it would cost taxpayers like him the answers if a majority of voters say yes the system would start running in  and essentially be a   health cooperative bigger than companies like nike and american express according to the colorado health institute an independent policy group a   elected board would set the benefits and budgets the system would be financed by payroll taxes of   percent for workers and   percent for employers it would impose a  percent tax on investment income people who are   and some   income in the contest for the democratic presidential nomination hillary clinton echoing many moderate democratic leaders here has said that she wants to keep and improve the affordable care act mr obamas signature legislative legacy but her opponent senator bernie sanders who won colorados democratic caucuses last month by nearly  points has advocated abandoning the health law for a medicare for all approach his proposal is similar to the coloradocare plan the campaign over the colorado initiative has had the unusual effect of putting conservative critics in the position of defending mr obamas health plan against an assault from the left at the same time it is energizing progressives who say the affordable care act was a giveaway to the insurance industry that even with an estimated  million people newly insured has left too many others without coverage no matter how long we hang in there with the affordable care act we will never cover everybody said jeanne nicholson a former democratic state senator and nurse who is a leading supporter of universal care here we dont understand why we should compromise and say some people can have bronze coverage some can have silver and some can have gold why cant we all have platinum plus nathan wilkes  who lives in the denver suburbs said that years of trying to get care for his son who has hemophilia had worn his family thin and made him an advocate for universal coverage he said the family had spent thousands of dollars and destroyed its credit because of insufficient coverage the affordable care act offered some benefits he said but its gaps were still too big and not sustainable  unlike its conservative neighbors colorado jumped to get on board with the affordable care act it set up its own insurance marketplace and expanded medicaid coverage for poorer residents but there have been stumbles people in mountain towns with few providers faced   premiums for coverage colorados biggest health cooperative colorado healthop shut down in october forcing more than   people to find new plans colorados plan would replace many private workplace plans but it would sit alongside medicare and federal health coverage for veterans and private insurers could still sell coverage to people who wanted more the colorado health institute an independent policy group said the plans passage would be the most   health care reform in any state since the affordable care act its replacing a system that i think has become really dysfunctional said irene aguilar a democratic state senator and physician who is leading the effort the game has been rigged by the   corporations to ensure they win  opponents say that it could wreck the states humming economy and drive away doctors and businesses and that its costs could spiral out of control if it passes coloradocare would become part of the state constitution and become virtually impossible to significantly alter without a statewide vote it would also fall outside the reach of the taxpayer bill of rights a  amendment to the colorado constitution that put strict limits on spending and new taxes it would be a disastrous economic impact on the state said walker stapleton colorados treasurer and a   of the opposition campaign if you think legalized pot brought a lot of people to colorado you should try free health care  like many other republicans here mr stapleton opposed the affordable care act and continues to criticize how it has been put in place but to defeat the new initiative he now finds himself defending the federal health law sean duffy a republican and a spokesman for the opposition campaign said many of his neighbors in the conservative denver suburb of highlands ranch had eagerly signed the petition to put the question on the november ballot because they saw it as a way to get rid of obamacare some democratic officials also oppose the states universal care effort they include gov john hickenlooper who said during his    fight that he was no big fan of the affordable care act  colorados previous democratic governor bill ritter also opposes it michelle lucero general counsel at childrens hospital colorado is among the health care officials lining up against the measure the hospital itself also opposes it she worries that it could threaten research dollars or drive away doctors theyre going to choose to

       " 'trump vows to broker israelipalestinian peace offers no new policies washington reuters  president donald trump vowed on wednesday to do whatever is necessary to broker peace between israel and the palestinians as he hosted palestinian president mahmoud abbas at the white house but gave no sign of how he could revive longstalled negotiations in their first meeting trump pressed abbas to do more to stop incitement to violence against israelis and according to the white house urged him in private to halt payments to families of palestinian prisoners held in israeli jails a demand long pressed by israel even as trump boldly predicted he would achieve peace where other presidents had failed he stopped short of explicitly recommitting his administration to a twostate solution to the decadesold conflict a longstanding foundation of us policy some palestinians said they were disappointed by the omission despite what many experts see as a longshot bid trump told abbas i will do whatever is necessary  i would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator and we will get this done abbas reasserted the goal of a palestinian state saying it must have east jerusalem as its capital with the borders that existed before the  middle east war  most israelis want all of jerusalem as their capital and reject a full return to  borderlines as a threat to their security trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough not least because his administration has yet to articulate a cohesive strategy for restarting the moribund peace process abbas white house talks followed a february visit by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who moved to reset ties after a combative relationship with the republican presidents predecessor democrat barack obama  trump sparked international criticism at the time when he appeared to back away from a twostate solution saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide palestinian statehood has been the objective of successive us administrations and the international community the meeting with abbas the westernbacked head of the palestinian authority was another test of whether trump in office a little more than  days is serious about pursuing the kind of comprehensive peace deal that eluded his predecessors trump insisted he was ready to try to reach the toughest deal but when he later sat down to lunch with the palestinian leader he said it was maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years trump who said he decided to start a process but offered no new policy prescriptions or timetable may be underestimating the challenge when trust between the two sides is low analysts said you cant just pretend you only have to handle a few key issues and thats it said david makovsky a member of obamas negotiating team during the last talks which collapsed in  still plans are being firmed up for trump to visit netanyahu in jerusalem and possibly abbas in the west bank on may  and  say people familiar with the matter that has sparked speculation about a meeting of the three us and israeli officials have declined to confirm the visit trump and abbas appeared friendly but businesslike as they stood at sidebyside lecterns but that was a far cry from the way trump and netanyahu interacted in february abbas promised that under your courageous stewardship and your wisdom as well as your great negotiating ability the palestinians would be partners seeking a historic peace treaty but under pressure at home to avoid major concessions the yearold leader said its about time for israel to end its occupation referring to jewish settlements in the west  bank abbas however did not repeat in public his demand that israel freeze settlement construction on land palestinians want for a state as a condition for negotiations us lawmakers have warned that palestinian funding could be cut off unless abbas halts plo stipends to families of prisoners whom israel considers terrorists but many palestinians see as heroes there was no indication abbas who governs in the west bank while hamas militants rule gaza bowed to pressure on the issue especially with hundreds of palestinian prisoners on hunger strike in gaza hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said the promises abbas made at the white house dont obligate anyone questions have been raised about trumps choice of soninlaw jared kushner to oversee the peace initiative along with trumps longtime business lawyer jason greenblatt as envoy efforts to enlist israels sunni arab neighbors who share israeli concerns about shiite iran to help rejuvenate peacemaking have yet to yield results national security adviser hr mcmaster described trumps foreign policy approach as disruptive saying his unconventional ways could create an opportunity to help stabilize the middle east but trumps unpredictability has even at times rattled a close ally like israel his proisraeli campaign rhetoric suggested he might give netanyahu free rein but trumps promise to move the us embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv is on the back burner and he caught netanyahu offguard by asking him to put unspecified limits on settlement activity ',\n",

the wrong path i thought our quarterly goal was for it modernization the email carried no specific call to action it barely had a point and was little more than badnatured griping it also came from kirby the cto the email triggered a fouralarm underpants fire as every manager on the smerps project tried to guess what kirby might possibly mean someplace between the frenzied cries of chris did you see kirbys email how do we reply someone had the bright idea that maybe this was just politics maybe kirby just wanted to feel like he was part of the process that his input was valued they could just schedule a little sitdown with kirby the pms and a few of the lead developers and smooth this whole thing over thus brittany found herself with an entire friday afternoon blocked off for a meeting none of the large conference rooms were available which meant three pms the project coordinator and four developers had to cram into a small office to review the plan thirty minutes into the meeting they were all huddled around the projector for warmth and the cto was a noshow that didnt dissuade management from trying to keep the meeting on track well while we wait for kirby chris said we can make sure were all on the same page lets review the current plan for the next two hours the pms nattered on about critical paths resource leveling and project milestones that were already unlikely to bear any resemblance to reality and would only slip farther with each new bit of overmanagement brittany was nearly asleep when chris called her name why dont you tell us about the technical side for the web team well brittany said smerps is a pretty straightforward crud app she noticed the vaguely surprised and offended look among some of the pms and quickly explained createreadupdatedelete a basic datamanagement tool the application needed to be accessible from the corporate office at manufacturing sites and at customer locations and work on mobile devices all in all its very similar to apps like rdr tpm and pluspoint so were planning to use the same techstack specifically sql server for the database c for the backend services and angular and typescript on the frontend a good stretch of the project could be scaffolded out with automated tools and most of the rest could be lifted from other projects the hard parts the  of the code thatd take  of the time to build were the places where it needed to talk to the erp system brittany was in the process of making this explanation when kirby swept into the room sorry im late he said and i cant stay long but i have a few issues id like this team to address first there are a lot of resources on this project i want you to be lean there should be one developer on this project thats impossible brittany said the cto rolled right over her it is if youre using the right tools before this meeting i did a little research and did you know that python is the number two programming language in the world were going to use that for this project which should make our developer more efficient this statement was greeted with silence and a vaguely shellshocked look the cto took this for agreement rapped his knuckles on the table and said great good get on that email me with any questions now if youll excuse me what a python might look like as the door closed behind kirby chris stepped up okay so you heard what the cto suggested lets not go making any big decisions just yet scott lisa i need you to write up a clearer picture of the erp side of the project and why we need multiple erp developers larry bob you do the same for the web team brittany before you leave for the day i need you to do an alternatives analysis that compares our current tech with python be objective and fair but well well indeed brittany had no real opposition to python as a language but definitely did not like the idea of making a massive shift just on a ctos whims she focused her analysis on a few key points first no one in their organization actually knew python their entire portfolio was some flavor of net and the newer projects had added angular their entire toolchain buildprocess continuous integration process etc all were built to support c and angular projects even beyond that python didnt perform as well as c and since the requirements wanted a singlepage application theyd need to use angular anyway  so there was no getting rid of angular brittany did her best to be thorough that was easy being polite was harder she was working late on friday night to get the document over to chris who was also working late when she hit send he instantly replied to her with a big thanks she went home and ignored work until monday on monday there was an email from chris got a meeting with kirby at am will follow up after at  brittany got an email from kirby saw your analysis he wrote but with  hour of research i can disagree with it angular and typescript is old python is new and google is writing everything with it python is the best practices for development the project was put on hold while everyone tried to talk some sense into kirby kirby was adamant though he read that google used python and so initech also needed to use python if our team still needs to use angular just use the python version were his final words on the subject brittany pulled chris aside chris does kirby even know what python is he clearly doesnt know what angular is what happens if we just say yes well use python  and then dont and thats how brittany completed her first major development project in python although it didnt actually contain a single line of python code advertisement manage it infrastructure as code across all environments with puppet  puppet enterprise now offers more control and insight with rolebased access control

money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country he

apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of fox news megyn kelly trumps campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of the apprentice a reality tv show where he barked a crowdpleasing youre fired at contestants who fell short in competitions his speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his iq he peppered them with dubiously

campaign called dangerous trump boasted of a fortune he put at  billion although in september forbes magazine estimated it at  billion making him the th richest american trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on th avenue in new york and not lose a single vote in may he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge  born in the united states to mexican immigrants  who was hearing a lawsuit against him no other candidate referred to the size

ignored the fact that the pentagon paid a pr firm half a billon dollars to make fake terroristnews videos   dr william thompson is a longtime senior cdc scientist he has published some of the most commonly cited provaccine studies  studies which purport to show absolutely no link between the mmr vaccine and autism for example two studies he and his coauthor published in  and  cdc studies were the most commonly cited studies used by the scientific community to debunk the controversy surrounding the mmr vaccineautism link  thompson et al  price et al   destefano et al   the study concluded that the evidence is now convincing that the measlesmumpsrubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autism spectrum disorder  source  a decade later dr thompson came out publicly admitting that that it was the lowest point  in his career when he went along with that paper he went on to say that he and the other authors didnt report significant findings and that he is completely ashamed of what he did that he was complicit and went along with this and regrets that he has been a part of the problem  source  source  source  a study with revised information and no data omission was published by dr brian hooker a contact of dr thompson in the peer reviewed journal translational neurodegeneration and it found a  increased risk of autism in african american boys receiving the measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine on time the study has since been retracted during the same time of this controversy   you can read the full study here  although unsurprisingly it has since been retracted thompsons attorneys robert f kennedy jr and bryan smith of morgan  morgan also released a statement from dr thompson which mentioned hooker  i have had many discussions with dr brian hooker over the last  months regarding studies the cdc has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders i share his belief that cdc decisionmaking and analyses should be transparent  source  even provaccine politicians were contacted as these documents were sent to congress one of them reads as followed as illustrated by congressman bill posey  the cdc coauthors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the mmr vaccine study the remaining four coauthors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can cdc blocking testimony disconcertingly thomas frieden see picture above the director of the centres for disease control cdc has blocked dr thompsons attempt to testify on scientific fraud and the destruction of evidence by senior cdc officials attorneys smith and kennedy have been seeking to have thompson testify on medical malpractice specifically with regard to fraud in a series of studies that found no link between vaccines and autism which are cited earlier in the article mr kennedy writes that according to thompson for the past decade his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data about the safety of the mercurybased preservative thimerosal to conceal its causative link to a suite of brain injuries including autism ecowatch  dr frieden said that dr william thompsons deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of cdc or hhs health and human services despite the fact that thompson revealed a casual link between vaccines and autism or autistic features frieden stated that dr william thompsons deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of cdc or hhd the case seeking the testimony of dr thompson is from the family of yearold yates hazlehurst a

       " 'he won because the elites want him there the global economy will collapse this article was written by melissa dykes and originally published at the daily sheeple  editors comment though trumps election was a great victoryrebuke over the dictates and controls of the financial oligarchy that own and run this nation the american people are not out of the woods yet quietly but constantly in the background of the entire obama administration the federal reserves stimulus program that combined unlimited qe with zero percent interest rates has absolutely wrecked this country and its economic stability the system as we know it cannot be sustained yellen and co have been simply waiting for the right time to let the other shoe drop  namely after it could influence the election even further in the direction of trumps populist uprising unfortunately he will now be largely blamed for the great destruction that is scheduled to fall upon this nation in fact that is the very reason that brandon smith of altmarketcom attributed to trumps victory when he predicted his election many months ago something big is coming prepare yourselves accordingly how altmarket predicted trumps win months in advance he won because the elites want him there the global economy will collapse by melissa dykeswhile many of us in the alternative media and especially those researchers of clinton crimes are breathing a big fat sigh of relief that anybody but hillary is headed to the white house in  brandon smith of alt market is warning us all not to get too comfortable and with history on his side here we should listen to himdespite what looked like a rigged fraudulent hillary win orchestrated from the top down with the entire establishment machine behind her trump won the election in an election year that would have otherwise seen record low voter turnout the specter of hillary that led to trumps victory has now given the people a reason to believe their vote actually matters again an extra boon to further relegitimize the corrupt system running things in this countrybut smith reminds us that if trump is walking into the oval office in january it is only because the elites decided to put him there in advance  and for a reasonfirst it should be noted that smith accurately predicted that brexit would pass  even when the majority of the alt media was reporting that there was no way it possibly could was it another victory for the peopleno it was predetermined well in advancethe mainstream media has been consistently comparing trump supporters to brexit supporters and trump himself has hitched his political wagon to the brexit this fits perfectly with the globalist narrative that populists and conservatives are killing the global economy and placing everyone at risk then he accurately predicted a trump win  but not because voting actually mattersus elections are indeed controlled and have been for decades primarily through the false leftright paradigm however as i have been pointing out since i correctly predicted the success of the brexit referendum i dont think that clinton is the choice of the elitesto be clear my position is that trump is slated to take the white house and that this is by design this has been my position since before trump won the republican primaries it was my position when the election cycle began it has never changed nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changedsmith says regardless of whether or not trump is a legitimate antiestablishment candidate his win means the global economic collapse the system has been holding off on will finally come to pass  as planned  under trumps watcheven if trump is a legitimate antiestablishment conservative his entry into the oval office will seal the deal on the economic collapse and will serve the globalists well the international banks need only pull the plug on any remaining life support to the existing market system and allow it to fully implode all while blaming trump and his conservative supportershe will be the perfect scapegoat for something the alternative media have known is coming for a long long timenow smith is spelling it out the bottom line is trump is on the way to the white house because the elites want him there now many liberty proponents currently in a state of elation will either ignore or dismiss the primary reason why i was able to predict the brexit and a trump win these will probably be some of the same people that were arguing with me only weeks ago that the elites would never allow trump in officeso to clarify trump may or may not be aware that he and his conservative followers have been positioned into a a trap we will have to wait and see how he behaves in office and he will be in office despite the claims of some that the elites will try to stop him before january my primary point is that it does not matter at least not at this stage the elites will initiate a final collapse of the global economy under trumps watch this will probably escalate over the course of the next six months and they will blame him and conservatives in general this is going to happen the elites play the long game and so must weand there you have itits not much of a secret that the economy is being artificially propped up the feds qe stimulus programs are no longer working we know it cant remain this way foreverand even though everyone just feels so much relief that weve all been spared the nightmare of hillary clinton climbing into yet another seat of even more power we cant just assume were all going to skip off into happy magical fairy sprinkle land unscathedsure the people have spoken but its only the illusion of power that were seeing play out now the powers that shouldnt be running this insanity circus always have a plan how else have they gotten away with controlling the globe for at least the past centuryafter saying i told ya so smith issued a final warning that we shouldnt be so naivewhile millions of americans are celebrating trumps win today i will remain even more vigilant the party is just getting started folks dont get too comfortablesadly we cant ignore decades of new world order history here just because were relieved a psychopath like hillary lost the election smith is right wed all do well to listen to him and get prepared for whats coming is going to be a bumpy

       " 'the surprising science of ceasefires even failures can help peace  the new york times even if this weeks   in syria quickly collapses     as most analysts expect it to     it could have a lasting impact on the conflict political science research shows that   change more than just conditions on the ground they alter how a wars participants weigh the benefits of fighting versus talking   can create something like a virtuous cycle studies have found making future pauses more likely each one has a better chance of lasting longer discouraging violations isolating bad actors and building trust among adversaries this cycle is not always as visible or politically urgent as the question of who is dropping bombs where on a particular day but over time it can shift the participants calculus in ways that build conditions for peace page fortna a columbia university professor and leading scholar on peace negotiations says that piecemeal deals though modest and rarely successful can eventually align the incentives of groups whose demands at the moment are unreconcilable but there is a flip side sometimes   can create a vicious cycle instead of a virtuous one distrust can deepen the parties can move further apart and incentives can shift to make peace even less attractive whether the diplomats who arranged the current   pause in syria know it or not they are making a     gamble two notre dame political scientists madhav joshi and j michael quinn last year published a study examining    and peace deals from  to  they found something surprising one of the best predictors of a peace agreements success is simply whether the parties had prior agreements even if those earlier   failed not even a wars duration or its intensity can so reliably predict a peace deals outcome neither does the poverty or ethnic diversity of the combatants failures pave the way for better agreements down the road professor quinn said over time participants see   as less risky if all sides come out feeling that they at least broke even they grow more willing to make another deal in syria with the status quo so terrible breaking even doesnt require much these items could be as simple as a request that assad refrain from calling opposition members terrorists in the press professors joshi and quinn wrote in a foreign affairs article summarizing their research as soon as one party reciprocates a peace process is underway and with each successful round just enough trust and good will may be generated to move on to the next item  this is trust not in the colloquial sense of proving personal integrity but in the political science sense negotiators believe they understand one anothers incentives and can predict their behavior each side becomes more willing to make concessions believing the other side will deliver on its end take for example yugoslavia where there were  mediated truces or   from  to  of those  percent lasted less than a week and  percent lasted exactly a week though each appeared to be a catastrophic failure they culminated in the  dayton accords which ended the bosnian war that was a subset of the larger conflict as well as later deals we are already seeing possible hints of this in syria the tempo of   is increasing with the terms expanding and the outside actors investing more political capital those gains are slight and the process of building trust is still fragile so it remains unclear whether the cycle will catch stephen b long a professor at the university of richmond found in a  paper looking at hundreds of cases from  to  that if   violations are consistently punished with some form of retaliation     strong enough to hurt but not to escalate     then everyone learns he is better off complying eventually all sides have less reason to fear theyll be betrayed and grow more confident entering otherwise risky   or peace talks this is among the reasons that the korean peninsula though still in a formal state of war has not had   fighting in decades each side has proved in countless    exchanges that it will punish any transgression by the other side freezing a conflict that had killed a million people the virtuous cycle takes hold when after enough rounds each side concludes that its adversaries will probably follow the terms of any agreement everyone profits if the terms of the   are carried out so everyone acts to enforce it this was often how multiparty wars like syrias broke from the cycle of   conflict professor fortna said this can take years one paper suggested that the cycle does not truly take hold until a   lasts for eight weeks that is a bar that syria has yet to clear but research papers that describe the dynamic are peppered with examples     burundi nepal the philippines northern ireland     that seemed unsolvable until they were suddenly solved if the great hope is that syrias warriors can learn to trust and cooperate then the great danger is that they will instead learn to distrust and reject if   violations are punished inconsistently combatants perceive cheating as less risky so while every transgression does not need to be punished its important that all sides be held to a similar standard for what will provoke retaliation and how severe if groups believe that everyone else is likely to cheat they have a strong incentive to cheat as well by the same token if groups come to see the other side as unreliable or unpredictable they have little reason to enter into any deal over successive rounds each side could bring less to the table or be less willing to follow through on its promises     further convincing one another that talks are not worthwhile this happened in angola where a civil war killed half a million people from  to  the united states and the soviet union saw it as a cold war battleground and both intervened they pushed their angolan proxies to keep fighting which destroyed trust on the ground     a worrying lesson as washington and moscow now find themselves on opposite sides in syria whether syria slips into a virtuous cycle or vicious one professor fortna said depends in large part on the united states and russia civil wars are much likelier to end in peace if they have a mediator often a powerful outside country according to research by the political scientist donald rothchild that mediator can impose stopgaps such as temporary   that open up space for negotiation and the mediator makes both sides more willing to take risks for peace because they trust that the other side will be punished if it fails to keep its word the   state of war between israel and egypt for example ended only when the united states brokered the  camp david accords president jimmy carter offered billions in aid to both countries altering their strategic calculus to make peace more attractive     and implicitly threatening washington disapproval if either party backed out mediation can take subtler forms such as norways role in hosting the s   talks the neutral setting reduced the political costs syria has no such mediator because the only two viable candidates     the united states and russia     are engaged in the war nor is either likely to allow another party such as the united nations to get in the middle professor fortna argued that interim united   agreements like this weeks could eventually move them into a sort of   role though this is politically distasteful in washington for appearing to put moscow on equal strategic and moral footings it is probably necessary but this would require both powers to demonstrate something they have yet been unable to the ability to extract concessions from their allies on the ground in syria only then could the united states and russia trust each others ability to follow through on their most important promises that would surely take multiple rounds to accomplish and would be only a step toward peace this can look like failure because it is so incremental and the success stories often take a decade or more theres not a lot of incentive to give the other guy the benefit of the doubt which is why wars are hard to end professor fortna said but they do end she

       " 'mayor de blasio avoids terrorism label in manhattan explosion  the new york times it was on the minds of new yorkers who immediately drew comparisons to sept   it could be felt in the police response which included teams of heavily armed officers stationed at key targets and the joint terrorism task force of the federal bureau of investigation and the police department but for mayor bill de blasio and top city officials terrorism was the word that could not be spoken on sunday seeking to project a responsible and measured reaction the mayor pointedly avoided calling the bombing in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan on saturday that injured  people     and the presence of a seemingly related but undetonated device a few blocks away     a possible act of terror declining at several points on sunday to do so he emphasized that there would be no easy answers and that no suspect had yet been apprehended absent a motivation mr de blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way here is what we know it was intentional it was a violent act it was certainly a criminal act it was a bombing     thats what we know he said on sunday flanked by law enforcement officials at police headquarters in lower manhattan to understand there were any specific motivations political motivations any connection to an organization     thats what we dont know  the approach appeared to be aimed at calming nerves in a city on edge and at avoiding a rush to conclusions both in new york city and across the country unlike other past events that were labeled terrorism including a  ax attack on police officers in queens by a man said to have been inspired by the islamic state the authorities have yet to identify a suspect or suspects in the bombing that would allow them to determine     through interviews or a history of online activity     the underlying reason for the attack the f b i as of late sunday had not officially labeled the attack as terrorism though hillary clinton the democratic nominee for president who is supported by mr de blasio released a statement that characterized it as among three apparent terror attacks on saturday including an explosion in new jersey and a knife attack in minnesota it could have been something personally motivated mr de blasio said we dont know yet  the approach by mr de blasio at news conferences over the weekend appeared similar to the initial response to another recent explosion in manhattan in which a man from virginia was seriously injured in july when he jumped on a device similar to a homemade firework in central park city officials quickly tried to dissociate that explosion from any broad terrorism plot instead labeling it the act of a hobbyist experimenting with fireworks this drew criticism from some new yorkers who felt officials did so in haste simply to quell fears no one has been arrested for placing or assembling the central park device and the police have not wavered from their initial hypothesis about the explosion the police later announced the device contained substances which are commonly and legally available for sale in certain hardware stores  one of the chemicals was tatp or triacetone triperoxide which has been used to detonate bombs in terror attacks overseas and has become the islamic states explosive of choice on sunday police officials said there was no link between the central park explosion and the one in chelsea in striking a tone of deliberation on sunday mr de blasio risked creating a dissonance between the dictionary definition of terrorism     violence with a political motive     and the creeping sense of inevitability that the terror attacks more common elsewhere in the world would find their way to new york to some mr de blasio also appeared to conflate terrorism in general     a deadly tactic with many political motives     with terrorism motivated or carried out by the islamic state and other radical muslim groups i believe the mayor was saying there was no connection with international terrorism and that is correct gov andrew m cuomo a fellow democrat said on sunday referring to the mayors comments the night before when he said there was no initial indication the bombing was terrorism a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism mr cuomo added but its not linked to international terrorism in other words we find no isis connection  the city has experienced bombings with a variety of motivations over the years from the weather underground which opposed the vietnam war to george p metesky the mad bomber who in the s and s terrorized the city with bombs in subway stations movie theaters and a macys department store his motive appeared to be anger at the electric company consolidated edison of late however many episodes later deemed terror attacks have been committed by homegrown extremists inspired by the islamic state or al qaeda before the news conference at police headquarters on sunday mr de blasio and mr cuomo toured the bombing scene on west rd street near avenue of the americas and spoke with residents and visitors at a diner a barbershop and inside a starbucks the two men     bitter political rivals     embraced before their tour and offered words of

could be the beginning of a forceful effort to help elect a democratic successor as president addressing rutgers universitys class of  at the schools th anniversary commencement mr obama never mentioned mr trump by name but his target was clear and his assessments earned raucous cheers from the graduates the world is more interconnected than ever before and its becoming more connected every day mr obama told the graduates building walls wont change that  mr trump the presumptive republican presidential nominee has proposed building a wall between the united states and mexico and forcing mexico to pay for its potential multibillion dollar construction costs mr trump has also denounced much of the modern international trading and economic system and he has proposed banning muslim visitors and immigrants from the country at least temporarily     all ideas mr obama condemned on sunday mr obama and mr trump have exchanged zingers before mr trump was a leading voice questioning mr obamas birth location and citizenship and mr obama has responded by taking particular delight in skewering mr trump but mr obama is altering his stump speech in important ways to go after mr trump as his remaining time in office draws to less than a school year mr obama has alternated between mild and mock horror pointed humor and a touch of disbelief in his attacks on the republican   we live in an age of global supply chains and a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed mr obama said but the answer isnt to stop trading with other countries in this global economy thats not even possible  mr obama said that isolating and disparaging muslims was not only a betrayal of american values but would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in combating violent extremism  wearing a crimson robe with black sashes and a purple doctoral hood that a fierce wind kept blowing off his shoulders mr obama told the graduates that the knowledge they had earned through years of studying was something they should insist political leaders value and possess themselves facts evidence reason logic an understanding of science     these are good things these are qualities you want in people making policy mr obama said adding later in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue  mr obama seemed to especially take pleasure in advocating the use of facts in politics while speaking to an academic audience his point with such arguments is usually to press for action against climate change one of the signature policies of his administration and one that nearly all climate scientists support but while mr obama mentioned climate change he also used his points about facts and experience to take yet another swipe at an unnamed mr trump he noted that when people get sick they want an experienced doctor to treat them when they fly they want experienced pilots and yet in our public lives we suddenly say i dont want somebody whos done it before he asked in derision mr trump has no experience as a politician a quality that has been viewed as one of the most important reasons for his success as a presidential candidate mr obama came to rutgers after students faculty members and even relatives of students spent the past three years lobbying the white house for him to speak on this anniversary for the school the truth is rutgers i came here because you asked you are the first to launch a   campaign he said emails letters tweets youtube videos i even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president mr obama said drawing laughter and i have to say that really sealed the deal that was smart because i have a soft spot for grandmas  but mr obama made clear that rutgers was precisely the kind of institution that he wanted to celebrate last week mr obama spoke at the commencement of howard university a historically black university and told the next generation of black leaders that passion must be tempered by strategic thinking and a willingness to compromise rutgers one of the first nine   institutions in the american colonies could be the most diverse student body in america he said and he likened rutgers long history of success with that of the country as a whole and while he celebrated that history he made clear to the graduates that no period in history was as prosperous as this one the good old days werent all that good mr obama said in fact by almost every measure america is better and the world is better than it was  years ago or  years ago or even eight years ago  one of mr obamas frustrations during his presidency has been the countrys persistently sour mood despite what he sees as a remarkable turnaround in the nations economy the passage of   health care legislation and the nations   strength militarily he cited those accomplishments and many others including declining rates of crime teenage pregnancy and poverty as well as improvements in life expectancy the status of blacks and latinos and clean energy marriage equality is the law of the land he added to robust cheers as he often does in such speeches mr obama told the graduates that they needed to participate in the political process and be satisfied with incremental change democrats generally fare better than republicans in   elections and while young people overwhelmingly support democrats they rarely vote so mr obama and michelle obama the first lady always urge student audiences to show up at the polls on election day because apathy has consequences

       " 'entering cage gold medalist kayla harrison helps a show become a sport  the new york times only one american has ever won an olympic gold medal in judo kayla harrison and she has won two in london in  and in rio this year yet despite her achievements harrison is the countrys   famous judoka no  is her former roommate ronda rousey who won a bronze medal in  and went on to fame fortune and magazine covers as the   fighter in mixed martial arts now harrison  plans to follow her into the cage in the world series of fighting organization if you had peeked through our apartment window in  and said one of you is going to win two olympic gold medals and one is going to become a sports icon we both would have said what are you talking about were eating ramen noodles and barely getting by harrison said four years ago if i wanted to be an m m a athlete its not something a female could really make a lot of money doing  harrison said referring to rousey she added she trailblazed a way for girls like me who want to make some money im hoping to stand on top of her shoulders and continue to have judo girls kill it in the cage  it will be quite a change for harrison the   world of olympic sports like judo is vastly different from the colorful crazy scene of mixed martial arts when asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts after winning her second gold medal in august harrison said i dont know if im cut out for a world where you get fights by how pretty you are and how you talk  she stands by that remark but said the world series of fighting is looking to bring some legitimacy to the sport and have real athletes who are treated like real athletes not w w e superstars i hope to see it go more toward the professional route versus the entertainment route but im not in charge  the man who is carlos silva the chief executive said i want people to perceive it as a sport not just a show a big part of that is adding sporting people like kayla  harrison competed in judo at  pounds but expects to fight at  pounds such discrepancies are not unusual rousey competed in judo at  but fights in the ultimate fighting championship at its highest weight class  women at  pounds have been somewhat overlooked in mixed martial arts in favor of smaller fighters the world series of fighting expects to add athletes to build up the division with its new star in mind the biggest name in the heavier division is cristiane justino known universally as cyborg currently signed with the u f c she is a fearsome competitor with a   record and a brutal knockout punch a match between her and rousey if it could be arranged would undoubtedly be one of the biggest in mixed martial arts history the bigger harrison though might be a more natural matchup for cyborg down the road im not going to go out in my first fight and fight cyborg harrison said that would be crazy  but she admitted i had a dream the other night that i was fighting cyborg and i got her in an armbar and i broke her arm but she wouldnt tap so i choked her unconscious  in rio when harrison was asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts her longtime coach jimmy pedro sitting next to her was seen shaking his head that pretty much sums up how he and his father feel about it harrison said of pedro and his father known as big jim they just feel like ive accomplished everything an athlete could ever dream of having such an amazing career in judo and i think personally they dont want to see me put that all on the line and see me get hurt  still harrison will continue to work with the pedros as well as adding training in disciplines like boxing and wrestling she said her serious training will begin in january harrison has no timetable for her first fight she will start her mixed martial arts experience as a commentator for the world series of fightings card at the theater at madison square garden on dec  the event will feature three championship bouts including lightweight champ justin gaethje against joo zeferino for a judoka transitioning into mixed martial arts the biggest issue is striking which is not allowed in judo i feel i have a great base because judo is takedowns and finishes armbars chokes harrison said when youre doing judo youre gripping your hands are moving so i already have that spatial awareness for striking which i think gives me an advantage learning a new sport ive been doing the same thing for  years everything i do in judo i learned in the first six months with the pedros now im learning new things im learning heel hooks and knee bars and a jab and a hook uppercuts its invigorating  still harrison is aware that the differences are there and that they are real soon for the first time she will be hitting people in the face and being hit in the face in return judo is controlled violence she said judo in japanese means the gentle way its about disarming your opponent or defending yourself but never killing them but m m a is   gladiating so yeah im scared absolutely i would be foolish not to be ',\n",

party nominations have usually been sewn up i cant remember the last time the new york primary actually mattered said bill weeden  a manhattan democrat who has voted religiously and with little impact on the primary process for decades this time we count  the reality produced an unusually intensive campaign in which candidates from both parties lavished their time and attention on frequently overlooked upstate towns like scotia and syracuse but much of the action on tuesday unfolded in the southern half of the state where the vast majority of new yorkers live and where new york city streets were filled with crisscrossing caravans of candidates and their armies of volunteers the five boroughs became a colorful canvass of campaign fliers and placards as supporters competed like   real estate agents to festoon lampposts and subway stairwells with their candidates name in manhattan broadway was a sea of baby blue bernie signs in the bronx   megaphones echoed with hillary

supports our police is a major thing said nicholas vasconi  throughout new york city individual voters kept finding ways to defy this years conventional wisdoms that jewish neighborhoods would

       " ' conservative writer calls black voters hillarys loyal slaves for not blindly supporting donald trump when conservatives refer to black people as  slaves  it totally undermines what little effort they put into trying to get their votesbut a conservative writer did exactly that in a racist article published by mediaite on tuesday in an attack on lebron james and mary j blige for endorsing hillary clintonin the opinion piece titled  lebron james mary j blige tell blacks to remain slaves to hillary vote their color not their conscience  author crystal wright referenced slavery and compared blacks to livestock right out of the gate in support of donald trump slavery ended in   wright began  yet blacks still act like the political chattel of the democrat sic party each election cycle blacks allow the democrat party and its proxies to tell them how to vote and they follow orders like loyal slaves the  election is turning out to be no different wright then goes on to whine about lebron james s recent endorsement of hillary clinton when i look at this year s presidential race it s clear which candidate believes the same thing  james said  only one person running truly understands the struggles of an akron child born into poverty and when i think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government the choice is clear that choice is hillary clinton how does hillary understand the struggle of a black kid born into poverty as james wrote when she s spent her entire year career as a politician doing nothing to fix the problem  wright respondedlet s start by pointing out that hillary clinton has been a lifelong advocate for ending poverty something the clinton administration actually made significant progress in achieving during the sin   percent of black families lived in poverty but during the clinton years when the economy boomed that percentage was cut to only  percent which is the lowest it has been in the last  yearssimilarly poverty stricken black families headed by single women also dropped to alltime lows during the clinton years from  percent in  to  percent in by the time the clintons left the white house more africanamerican had been lifted out of poverty than during any other presidency but those gains were soon reversed after republicans took over in january in short why should black voters risk things getting even worse under trump when they can put a woman in the white house who was there when things were getting betterbut wright wasn t done insulting black voters of course we know lebron s oped is directed only to blacks  she continued  because white people don t look to professional athletes for voting instructions white americans are not a monolithic voting group which is why their vote influences policy lebron james did not instruct black people to vote for clinton he asked them along with everyone else that s because james has white fans hispanic fans and female fans too just because he is black doesn t mean he only has black fans assuming otherwise is blatantly racist also assuming that white people are not influenced by athletes is just ridiculouswright then concludes by telling black people to vote for trumpas for hillary she is no more viable a candidate for blacks than she is for women the only life that matters to hillary is her own and a careerlong obsession with winning the office she s coveted for a lifetimeyet celebrities like lebron james want blacks to feel good voting for their color over their conscience what do blacks have to lose voting for trump absolutely nothingactually black people have everything to lose if trump winswhen the conservativecontrolled supreme court struck down a key portion of the voting rights act it was a signal that republicans intend to tear down landmark legislation that protects the constitutional rights of africanamericans republicans including trump have also called for repealing the th amendment which overturned the dred scott ruling that americans descended from african slaves can t be united states citizensfurthermore republicans have enacted voter suppression laws in several states which primarily targets black peoplealso trump s track record with black people is pretty shitty for one he s only just now beginning to reach out to them but that s only because his poll numbers suck and he is desperate but he called for the death penalty for the central park five who spent years in prison for a rape they did not commit and trump was sued in the s for refusing to rent to black people plus unlike the clintons trump has no record to offer as reasons why black people should vote for him hillary clinton doesclinton is still a champion for reducing poverty and caring for children and families and her husband s economic policies helped lift millions of blacks out of poverty wright talks about black voters as if they are mindless drones on some kind of modern plantation but the fact is that democrats have fought for equality and civil rights for decades while republicans have done nothing but stand in the way or try to roll back the progress made while democrats have worked hard to earn the support of black voters republicans turned their backs on them a long time ago and have done nothing over the last century to earn back their support donald trump will not change that especially when his biggest supporters are white supremacistscalling black people slaves just because they support a certain party is reprehensible and it s a reason why black voters reject conservatives but you can be certain that trump s kkk buddies are absolutely thrilled about wright s words after all they really do want black people to be slavesfeatured image joe

       " 'wall st regulators propose stricter pay rules for bankers  the new york times regulators released   rules on thursday morning that aim to restrict how big financial institutions can pay their top executives the new limits on banker bonuses would make the   employees at the biggest banks wait at least four years to receive parts of their annual pay if the proposals are completed in the coming months banks would also have to reclaim bonuses from bankers who take risks that lead to big financial losses the regulators are responding to an uproar of criticism over wall streets pay practices after the biggest american banks had to take government bailout money during the  financial crisis that public anger has been rekindled during the  presidential campaign season putting pressure on regulators to tighten their oversight of wall street the new rules on executive pay grew out of the    financial overhaul but it has taken years to put them into practice even though president obama has pushed regulators to complete them the administration is running out of time to get rules approved before a new president is elected rick metsger the vice chairman at the national credit union administration     one of six agencies responsible for drafting the rules     said on thursday that politicians and the public want senior executives at large financial institutions held accountable if their desire for personal enrichment leads to   that results in material losses  the structure of executive pay packages before the financial crisis was blamed for encouraging bankers to take unnecessary risks in some cases pay was set up in ways that motivated bankers to seek   gains even if their actions led to losses over the longer term the new rules will force many banks to withhold pay for longer than they have in the past to ensure that top employees can be held accountable for the   consequences of their   the proposals leave many financial firms including large asset managers and hedge funds shielded from the new restrictions because of the way the regulators have defined which institutions are subject to them young wall street workers and potential recruits who might once have aspired to jobs in the industry are already decamping for less regulated corners of finance and corporate america including silicon valley for those institutions subject to the rules the new restrictions are broadly in line with changes that many banks have already been making since the financial crisis for instance it is already an industry standard to wait three years to release   bonuses the new rules aim to push that to four years there has been less consistency in how banks have approached seizing pay from employees if their actions lead to losses the new proposal makes bankers pay vulnerable to   clawbacks for seven years after the pay is received if they are found to have engaged in misconduct or taken actions that led to big losses steven eckhaus an expert on executive compensation at cadwalader wickersham  taft said he did not see the new rules having a big impact except around the margins  this largely codifies the practices that have evolved over the last eight years he said the regulators were supposed to propose the new rules within  days of  s passage instead the regulatory agencies delivered a first draft of the rules in  but that draft was widely panned as being too weak in the previous draft the largest banks had to hold back at least  percent of all   pay for three years under the new proposals the same banks will have to withhold  percent of that pay for four years the new draft also applies the limits to a broader set of material   at big banks not just top executives marcus stanley the policy director at the advocacy organization americans for financial reform said the new version was stronger than the  proposal but did not push the banks to go far enough beyond already accepted practices he said for instance that he had hoped that banks would have to hold back pay for more than four years because big losses on bank investments can often take longer than that to materialize in britain by contrast banks are now forced to hold back some pay for at least seven years european countries have generally imposed stronger restrictions on executive compensation since the financial crisis including some hard caps on salary and bonuses the new american rules would apply only to   compensation     generally bonuses     which varies according to the performance of the bank and the individual executive even without the rules banks have faced steady pressure from regulators and shareholders since the financial crisis to change the way they pay their employees and tie more compensation to a firms   rather than   success jpmorgan chase for instance recently announced that it was altering the pay package of its chief executive jamie dimon so that he is compensated primarily with stock that he will receive only if the firm achieves certain levels of future profitability mr dimon will get the stock after five years which is longer than the new rules propose banks and other financial institutions have generally been cutting pay in recent years because of their lagging performance and other parts of the   legislation have limited their ability to take big risks and earn the big profits that were common before the financial crisis this week goldman sachs said that the pool of money it had put aside so far this year for employee compensation is  percent smaller than it was at the same time last year the new rules were debated and described for the first time at a meeting on thursday of the national credit union administration the first of the six agencies to take up the proposal the public

       " 'trump won with lowest minority vote in decades fueling divisions washington reuters  donald trump won the us presidency with less support from black and hispanic voters than any president in at least  years a reuters review of polling data shows highlighting deep national divisions that have fueled incidents of racial and political confrontation trump was elected with  percent of the black vote  percent of the hispanic vote and  percent of the asianamerican vote according to the reutersipsos election day poll among black voters his showing was comparable to the  percent captured by george w bush in  and ronald reagan in  but bush and reagan both did far better with hispanic voters capturing  percent and  percent respectively according to exit polling data compiled by the nonpartisan roper center for public opinion research  and trumps performance among asianamericans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in  the racial polarization behind trumps victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election in white supremacist victory celebrations in antitrump protests and civil rights rallies and in hundreds of racist xenophobic and antisemitic hate crimes documented by the southern poverty law center splc which tracks extremist movements the splc reports there were  incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation between the day following the nov  election and nov  with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote    signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation    the loyal white knights of the ku klux klan a white separatist group that vilifies africanamericans jews and other minorities plans an unusual dec  rally in north carolina to celebrate trumps victory leftwing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the presidentelects jan  inauguration and a womens march on washington scheduled for the following day is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest trumps presidency    american politics became increasingly racialized through president barack obamas two terms but there was an attempt across the board across the parties to keep those tensions under the surface says jamila michener an assistant professor of government at cornell university  trumps antiimmigrant antimuslim rhetoric brought those divisions to the fore it activated people on the right who felt empowered and it activated people on the left who saw it as a threat she added    that dynamic was evident last week    when vice presidentelect mike pence attended the broadway musical hamilton in new york on friday the multiethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a trump presidency a far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about  people cheered trumps election at a washington conference of the national policy institute a white nationalist group with a strong antisemitic beliefs     we willed donald trump into office we made this dream our reality npi president richard spencer said after outlining a vision of america as a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity he closed with hail trump hail our people hail victory though trumps election victory was driven by white voters his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors reagan and george hw bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the  percent that trump achieved     the historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in american politics but the division surrounding trump appears more profound says cas mudde an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the university of georgia these days he adds people say they dont want their children even to date someone from the other party    indeed voters opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows surveys by the pew research center showed this year that majorities of both parties held very unfavorable views of the other party  a first since the center first measured such sentiment in  and the lions share of those people believe the opposing partys policies are so misguided that they threaten the nations wellbeing the center found    that level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction    in the wake of trumps victory protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country in some cases causing property damage  much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that trumps administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters says james anderson editor of itsgoingdownorg an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against trumps presidency including a call to disrupt his inauguration    many on the left have come to distrust government institutions embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces anderson says the answer now is to organize build power and autonomy and fight back    on the opposite end of the political spectrum trumps election is bringing new hope for rightwing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties     john roberts a top officer in the ku klux klan affiliate planning the december rally to celebrate trumps election says the group is committed to nonviolent demonstrations but he sees trumps election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict and much of the strife he says will be centered around racial divisions    once trump officially takes office there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time roberts says who knows when thats going to be but its not going to be pretty ',\n",

       " 'exclusive as democratic attorneys general target trump republican ags target them reuters  for years the national political organizations of both democratic and republican state attorneys general observed an agreement not to target the other partys incumbent officeholders in elections  that handsoff stance ended this month when republican ags voted to abandon the agreement and spend money to help unseat democrats in other states according to the republican attorneys general association the decision has not been previously reported  the move comes as democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of republican president donald trumps policies state ags in washington and hawaii successfully sued to block trumps executive orders restricting travel from some muslimmajority countries and californias attorney general has pledged to defend the states environmental standards  republican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that ags should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents two sources familiar with the closed door process said additionally a desire by some to roll back samesex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision said the sources who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations  the socalled incumbency rule observed by the state attorneys party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of us politics aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest such as consumer protection  attorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own ags took tobacco companies to court in the s and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the  financial crisis in larger states an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources  twelve republican state ags on monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting trumps revised travel restrictions  scott will executive director of the republican attorneys general association confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule but declined to discuss specifics of the vote  the stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table will said in a statement to reuters  the vote was taken over the phone with a tally of  the two sources said not every republican ag participated  some of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents so ags shouldnt be any different the sources said  those opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship and noted that republican ags had grown their ranks under the current system showing there was no need to change the rules now the sources said  in  republicans held  of the  state ag positions including the district of columbia but that number is about to hit  if a nomination made by new hampshires republican governor this month is confirmed  one of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in virginia where attorney general mark herring a democrat is seeking reelection this november in all  ag elections are scheduled for  republicans currently hold  of those seats compared to  for democrats but some of the incumbents may not run for reelection  karl racine attorney general for the district of columbia and current cochair of the democratic attorneys general association said the republican groups decision likely means democrats will follow suit  whats good for the goose is good for the gander racine said in an interview  colorado attorney general cynthia coffman a republican is up for election next year in a state that has been trending democrat a wellfunded push to unseat her something the democratic ag group wouldnt have participated in under the incumbency agreement could spell trouble  coffman opposed the incumbency rule change the sources said her office did not respond to a request for comment  in laying out the reasons for the rule change will pointed to the key role republican ags played in opposing some of president barack obamas policies  rolling back samesex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations said the two people familiar with the discussion more republican state ags could help further that effort though the current composition of the us supreme court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely  additionally the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating democratic ags the two sources said  participants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage hour energy the sources said the money depended on the republican group changing its rules to target incumbent democrats  the company that manufactures hour energy innovation ventures declined to comment a spokesman for the republican ag group declined to answer questions about the debate including the role of hours pledge  innovation ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink with varied outcomes  last month a washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly  million in one such case brought by bob ferguson the democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block trumps first travel restrictions the company has said it would appeal the ruling in at least two other cases in oregon and indiana innovation ventures prevailed oregon has appealed  the precise dollar amount of the companys pledge to republican ags could not be determined nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target democrats  already the republican attorneys general association has built a fundraising advantage in  it raised about  million including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the judicial crisis network and koch industries according to tax filings  sean rankin executive director of the democratic ag group said it raised about  million in  the groups tax filings show a mix of contributors including companies plaintiff

       " 'trump advisors aim to privatize oilrich indian reservations washington reuters  native american reservations cover just  percent of the united states but they may contain about a fifth of the nations oil and gas along with vast coal reserves now a group of advisors to presidentelect donald trump on native american issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to  million acres of tribal lands two chairmen of the coalition told reuters in exclusive interviews  the group proposes to put those lands into private ownership  a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve indian tribes on usowned reservations which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations  the tribes have rights to use the land but they do not own it they can drill it and reap the profits but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property we should take tribal land away from public treatment said markwayne mullin a republican us representative from oklahoma and a cherokee tribe member who is cochairing trumps native american affairs coalition as long as we can do it without unintended consequences i think we will have broad support around indian country trumps transition team did not respond to multiple requests for comment the plan dovetails with trumps larger aim of slashing regulation to boost energy production it could deeply divide native american leaders who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation the proposed path to deregulated drilling  privatizing reservations  could prove even more divisive many native americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal selfdetermination and culture our spiritual leaders are opposed to theprivatization of our lands which means thecommoditization of the nature water air we hold sacred said tom goldtooth a member of both the navajo and the dakota tribes who runs the indigenous environmental networkprivatization has been the goal since colonization  to strip native nations of their sovereignty reservations governed by the us bureau of indian affairs are intended in part to keep native american lands off the private real estate market preventing sales to nonindians an official at the bureau of indian affairs did not respond to a request for comment the legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between  and  to end wars between indigenous indians and european settlers tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members leaders of trumps coalition did not provide details of how they propose to allocate ownership of the land or mineral rights  or to ensure they remained under indian control one idea is to limit sales to nonindian buyers said ross swimmer a cochair on trumps advisory coalition and an exchief of the cherokee nation who worked on indian affairs in the reagan administration it has to be done with an eye toward protecting sovereignty he said the trumpappointed coalitions proposal comes against a backdrop of broader environmental tensions on indian reservations including protests against a petroleum pipeline by the standing rock sioux tribe and their supporters in north dakota on sunday amid rising opposition the us army corps of engineers on sunday said it had denied a permit for the dakota access pipeline project citing a need to explore alternate routes  the trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline however and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in january  tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations the council of energy resource tribes a tribal energy consortium estimated in  that indian energy resources are worth about  trillion in  the bureau of indian affairs testified before congress that reservations contained about  percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the us deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including devon energy corp occidental petroleum bp and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment trumps transition team commissioned the member native american affairs coalition to draw up a list of proposals to guide his indian policy on issues ranging from energy to health care and education  the backgrounds of the coalitions leadership are one sign of its prodrilling bent at least three of four chairlevel members have links to the oil industry mullin received about eight percent of his campaign funding over the years from energy companies while cochair sharon clahchischilliage  a republican new mexico state representative and navajo tribe member  received about  percent from energy firms according to campaign finance disclosures reviewed by reuters  swimmer is a partner at a native americanfocused investment fund that has invested heavily in oil and gas companies including energy transfer partners  the owner of the pipeline being protested in north dakota etp did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the fourth cochair eddie tullis a former chairman of the poarch band of creek indians in alabama is involved in casino gaming a major industry on reservations clahchischilliage and tullis did not respond to requests for comment several tribes including the crow nation in montana and the southern ute in colorado have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate muchneeded revenue for tribe members and finance health education and infrastructure projects on their reservations but a raft of federal permits are required to lease mortgage mine or drill  a bureaucratic thicket that critics say contributes to higher poverty on reservations  as us oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade tribes struggled to capitalize a  report from the government accountability office found that poor management by the bureau of indian affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes  the time it takes to go from lease to production is three times longer on trust lands than on private land said mark fox chairman of the three affiliated tribes in forth berthold north dakota which produces about  barrels of oil per day  if privatizing has some kind of a meaning that rights are given to private entities over tribal land then that is worrying fox acknowledged but if it has to do with undoing federal burdens that can occur there might be some justification the contingent of native americans who fear triballand privatization cite precedents of lost sovereignty and culture the dawes act of  offered indians private lots in exchange for becoming us citizens  resulting in more than  million acres passing out of indian hands between the s and s said kevin washburn who served as assistant secretary for indian affairs at the department of the interiorfrom  until he resigned in december  privatization of indian lands during the s is widely viewed as one of the greatest mistakes in federal indian policy said washburn a citizen of oklahomas chickasaw nation congress later adopted the socalled termination policy in  designed to assimilate native americans into us society over the next decade some  million acres of land were removed from tribal control and  native americans lost their tribal affiliation  mullin and swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations they said they also will aim to retain federal support to tribes which amounts to nearly  billion a year according to a department of interior report in  mullin said the finalized proposal could result in congressional legislation as early as next year washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass but gabe galanda a seattlebased lawyer specializing in indian law said it could be possible with republican control of the white house and the us house and senate  legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a us supreme court with a conservative majority he said trump will soon have the chance to nominate a supreme court justice to replace antonin scalia a conservative member who died earlier this year with this alignment in the white house congress and the supreme court he said we should be concerned about erosion of self determination if not a return to termination ',\n",

threatening to  totally destroy  the country of  million people and mocking its leader kim jong un as a  rocket man  in a hardedged speech to the united nations general assembly trump offered a grim portrait of a world in peril adopted a more confrontational approach to solving global challenges from iran to venezuela and gave an unabashed defense of us sovereignty   the united states has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea  trump told the member world body sticking closely to a script  as loud startled murmurs filled the hall trump described kim in an acid tone saying  rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime  his remarks rattled world leaders gathered in the greenmarbled general assembly hall where minutes earlier un secretarygeneral antonio guterres appealed for statesmanship saying  we must not sleepwalk our way into war  trump s most direct military threat to attack north korea in his debut appearance at the general assembly was his latest expression of concern about pyongyang s repeated launching of ballistic missiles over japan and underground nuclear tests swedish foreign minister margot wallstrom crossed her arms during the speech  it was the wrong speech at the wrong time to the wrong audience  wallstrom later told the bbc a junior north korean diplomat sat in the delegation s frontrow seat for trump s speech the north korean un mission said the mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment  in germany chancellor angela merkel said she would do everything in her power to ensure a diplomatic solution  anything else would lead to disaster  she said trump s saberrattling rhetoric with the bareknuckled style he used to win election last november was in contrast to the comments of some of his own cabinet members who have stated a preference for a diplomatic solution defense secretary james mattis who earlier this month raised the prospect of a  massive military response  if needed on tuesday told pentagon reporters that secretary of state rex tillerson was working to resolve the crisis diplomatically interviewed by fox news tillerson highlighted washington s policy of pressuring north korea through sanctions  we have the strictest sanctions ever put in place we do believe there are early signs of those having an effect  he said  ultimately though we re going to need the assistance of the neighbors in the region     reaction in the united states to trump s speech was mixed mitt romney the  republican presidential nominee tweeted that trump a fellow republican  gave a strong and needed challenge  to un members to confront global challenges but democrat ed markey of the us senate foreign relations committee denounced trump s remarks telling cnn the president had yet to exhaust his other options in encouraging pyongyang to negotiate in a thunderous speech  minutes long according to the official transcript trump took aim at iran s nuclear ambitions and regional influence venezuela s collapsing democracy and the threat of islamist extremists  major portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell  he said his speech recalled the fiery nationalist language of his jan  inaugural address when he pledged to end what he called an  american carnage  of rusted factories and crime his strongest words were directed at north korea he urged un member states to work together to isolate the kim government until it ceases its  hostile  behavior in an apparent prod at china the north s major trading partner trump said  it is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict  the un security council has unanimously imposed nine  rounds of sanctions on north korea since  and guterres appealed for that member body to maintain its unity turning to iran trump called the  nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor barack obama an embarrassment and hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for a midoctober deadline  we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program  he said he said the iranian government  masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy  iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif tweeted a withering response  trump s ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times  not the st century un  unworthy of a reply fake empathy for iranians fools no one  french president emmanuel macron in his un speech said his country would not close the door to negotiations over north korea and staunchly defended the iran nuclear deal  renouncing it would be a grave error  macron said trump called the collapsing situation in venezuela  completely unacceptable  and warned the united states was considering what further actions it can take  we cannot stand by and watch  he said venezuela rejected trump s threats and said it was prepared to resist any us actions even a military invasion at what was billed as an  antiimperialist  rally in caracas venezuelan president nicolas maduro described trump as  the new hitler of international politics  stocks bonds and currency markets ended

to capitol hill on wednesday and thursday sheryl sandberg facebook s chief operating officer met with leaders of the house intelligence committee and said the company wanted to help investigators and would turn over more information  things happened on our platform that shouldn t have happened  in the leadup to the election sandberg told the axios website on thursday so far however the

provide the rest of the information from accounts linked to russia the spokesman said     the sources said investigators were also pressing twitter google and other companies for similar data and urging twitter to conduct a more comprehensive search of its data banks  we have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion  a google spokeswoman said asked about the issue  we are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems working with researchers and other companies and will provide

       " 'in  americas liberal abortion agenda looks a lot like nazi eugenics st century wire says here s an unusual but extremely thoughtprovoking political take on the events of last week in charlottesville in the context of america and western society as a wholewhat you are about to read will be considered very controversial by many people this is an uncomfortable topic which generally no one enjoys talking about many readers may not want to hear it you may not want to hear it either it s a caustic conversation for sure you might think the author is being overdramatic or maybe you won t but it s a discussion which at least half of america wants to havethe publication the blaze touts itself as  christian conservative  and regularly exaggerate and politicizes its content and frequently applies a moralistic or evangelical spin to it for those reasons it would be convenient for some to simply dismiss the article below because of its source however the fundamental comparison presented should be seriously considered and really should be discussed more in mainstream forums in  any challenging commentary regarding the topic of abortion is fiercely opposed by  progressive  gatekeepers and women s rights activists who will often cite the  us supreme court decision of roe vs wade as a cue to end any debate on the issue this subject is also suppressed in most public and academic forums   and it s strictly offlimits in the liberal mainstream corporate media but society cannot continually sweep this under the rug   america has to have this conversation because it goes to the heart of the question what kind of society do we live in   by matt walshit was interesting timing on monday cbs published an article touting iceland s miracle cure for down syndrome  iceland is on pace to virtually eliminate down syndrome through abortion  the headline read of course it leaves out an important word iceland is eliminating down syndrome people  not down syndrome itself by killing anyone who has the condition many countries including our own have discovered an identical treatment planthe next day oregon was the beneficiary of similarly sanitized headlines the governor of oregon signed legislation expanding reproductive health access  the media reported but the reports are misleading the law actually forces all residents in the state to pay for abortions for anyone who wants them including illegal aliens the bill has nothing at all to do with reproduction its goal is precisely to stop reproduction or at least to prevent the products of reproduction from ever seeing the light of dayi said the reports of these atrocities are interestingly timed because they come amidst a national panic over neonazism we are right to be disgusted and horrified by the few dozen white supremacist losers who carried tiki torches through charlottesville on saturday and we are right to demand justice for the woman who was killed by a skinhead terrorist during that same rally but we are ridiculous for acting as if these racist nerds represent some threat to our national existence until there is even a shred of proof to the contrary i am going to remain confident that the vast vast vast majority of our citizens do not sympathize with nazism outright even one neonazi is too many a whole parade of them is a travesty but we ought not lose our grip on reality a little perspective is all i m suggestingnow the reader may have noted the conspicuous qualifier in the previous paragraph the majority of our citizens do not sympathize with nazism outright many however sympathize with some of the primary goals and most brutal tactics of the nazi party  though they may not think of it in those terms they still celebrate the achievement of  eliminating  medical conditions by killing the babies who have it and they applaud governments that  expand reproductive health access  by forcing helpless citizens to fund the mass extermination of human beings they may not march through the streets waving swastikas around but they look with indifference or approval at our own version of the nazi death camp indeed with all due respect to the skinheads who only play pretend nazi the spirit of the nazi movement really lives on in the abortion industry planned parenthood may not hang the nazi flag on the doors of its clinics but it has enough blood on its hands to impress even the most prolific concentration camp executioneri made this point yesterday and i was informed   even by some  conservative  folk   that it is utterly inappropriate and insensitive for me to make such comparisons especially when a woman was just killed by a neonazi well i feel terribly for that woman s family and i hope for the swiftest and harshest judgment allowed under the law to be done upon her murderer but i also feel terribly for the  or so human beings who were executed in abortion clinics since saturday and the  million who ve been exterminated since  i don t think there is ever an inappropriate time to acknowledge them particularly when so many of us have dedicated ourselves to never acknowledging them and especially during a week when the very people who support the continued legalization and tax funding of abortion death camps are running around accusing everyone else of condoning nazismi m sorry but i just cannot physically stomach a  you should be more forceful in condemning nazism  lecture from someone who has spent the last  years demanding that we applaud while millions of people have their skulls crushed by abortionists even less can i tolerate someone who wants to protect the innocent by tearing down historical statues but cries about human rights violations when someone vandalizes a building where actual human beings are butchered and sold for partsi do not pretend that all of the political goals of the proabortion left line up completely with the political goals of nazis in  s germany there are some striking similarities   particularly the politicization of  public health  the focus on environmental conservation and the total disregard for free speech   but that is not the point i say that abortion enthusiasts have the spirit of nazism because that spirit is more than anything one of brutality moral indifference and absolute disregard for human life it is a spirit that leads to mass exterminations and bloodshed on a scale that can hardly be fathomed it is a spirit that compels a people to strive for collective perfection by killing the undesirables nazis exterminated the disabled just as we do and they killed jews and poles and catholics and many other groups our focus is not racial cleansing but economic we kill poor children  unwanted  children  defective  children children who we ve decided will be more trouble than they re worth they are a  burden on society  we say echoing nazi propaganda almost verbatimand we build facilities which we dedicate to carrying out this cleansing the nazi death camp was never abolished you see it was simply relocated and rebranded today we call it a  reproductive health clinic  but what happens inside more closely resembles auschwitz than it does your pediatrician s officeso yes speak out against those ridiculous bigots who ve latched onto nazism in their desperate quest for purpose and attention but if you want to oppose what they stand for you need to look beyond them and towards that planned parenthood clinic you drive by every day on the way to work and if those nazi wannabes in charlottesville intend to be the ones in our country who best emulate their nazi role models it must be said that they are lagging far behind especially in terms of body counts right now the tally is about  million to one last i checkedthey have a lot of catching up to

superpower hit by a flood of cheap imports from china and other countries the us steel industry has brought  new cases in the past three years seeking punitive duties from the commerce department to combat belowcost dumping and unfair subsidies that slashed prices of various steel products to historic lows last year causing layoffs at us steel mills see graphic tmsnrtrsgufgaf some of these cases have resulted in massive penalties against chinese imports including duties of more than  percent on chinese coldrolled steel used in autos and appliances    lawyers robert lighthizer and jeffrey

declined to comment for this story or did not respond to reuters requests for interviews trade experts familiar with their views and their history of confrontation with china however say they will not be afraid to push the limits of what is legal under world trade organization rules in defense of us trade interests   lighthizer who along with dimicco is considered a strong candidate to be the new us trade representative is known for his work during the reagan administration pressuring japan into voluntary export restraints  bob lighthizer is very smart very strategic and totally fearless said a washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades and asked not to be named because trumps ustr selection process was still under way if hes in charge you can expect him to use every tool available to create leverage to get china and anyone else to stop the cheating he is no fan of the wto lighthizer told a congressional panel in  that the wtos dispute resolution system was ineffective and that the united states should consider aggressive interpretations of wto provisions that might help us deal with chinese mercantilism such tactics could include imposing temporary import quotas and surcharges and factoring in the effect of currency manipulation into us antidumping duties he said ross who advised trumps presidential campaign on economic issues has signaled he will use access to the lucrative us consumer market as leverage to negotiate better trade terms the united states is chinas biggest export market during his presidential campaign trump vowed to levy a punitive percent tariff on chinese goods and label beijing a currency manipulator it is not clear though whether he will follow through on those threats once he takes office ross told cnn last week that trump will not be willy nilly slapping a  percent tariff on everything but will maintain the threat of tariffs as part of negotiations in an emailed statement to reuters ross said he would divest all holdings and board seats that pose conflicts but declined to answer other questions on his plans for trumps trade policy and engagement with china  the personal blog of dimicco meanwhile gives some indication of how he would approach china if he was named head of ustr he has accused china of waging a mercantilist trade war on the united states for two decades through currency manipulation unfair subsidies and intellectual property theft on the issue of currency manipulation many economists disagree saying beijing is no longer keeping its yuan artificially undervalued to make its exports cheap citing the hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves it has spent to prop up the yuans value this year a key question for trumps trade team is how far they can push china to change its trade practices without provoking a trade war that will hurt both countries if what they plan to do is get a little scratchier with china on enforcement within the existing wto rules thats ok said scott miller a china trade expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington but if they go outside those guardrails it will be unpleasant because that will draw retaliation  he weiwen vice president at the center for china and globalization a governmentaffiliated thinktank in beijing said any punitive action against china by the trump administration would invite a retaliatory response we will certainly respond in the same way he said adding that washington and beijing should find good solutions that are acceptable to both and not go to extremes it will hurt both chinese state media have warned that any new tariffs imposed by trump would lead to retaliation against boeing aircraft apple iphones and us corn and soybeans ',\n",

zoological society of london zsl and wwf suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach twothirds among vertebrates by  the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed ',\n",

       " 'john kerry urges grounding of military aircraft in key areas of syria  the new york times united nations     secretary of state john kerry on wednesday called for an immediate grounding of all military aircraft in what he described as key areas of syria     including where aid is delivered     as a   effort to save an agreement with russia to reduce violence and ultimately halt a war that shows no sign of slowing speaking in an unusually pointed and partly unscripted session at a united nations security council meeting on the syria crisis mr kerry angrily accused russia of living in a parallel universe and allowing president bashar   of syria to extend the greatest humanitarian catastrophe since world war ii  on monday a convoy of trucks taking aid to the besieged city of aleppo was destroyed in a deadly airstrike and american officials said russia was responsible the russians have denied that and questioned evidence that it was an airstrike at all the united nations has not confirmed what struck its trucks it was a striking change in tone for mr kerry usually the perpetual optimist who only  days ago had welcomed a   agreement for a reduction in violence a grounding of the syrian air force and ultimately the   of the islamic state and nusra front terrorist groups with his russian counterpart sergey v lavrov but beyond mr kerrys anger was a hard truth if russia and syria reject the idea of a halt in flights there is little the united states is prepared to do to enforce one president obama several years ago rejected the option of creating a   zone to protect refugees and now with russian jets in the air over syrian airspace the chances of confrontation are far higher the doubling down on the agreement even as it was in tatters reflected the obama administrations assumption that it lacks better alternatives for dealing with the   civil war in syria that has left roughly a   people dead but president obama devoted only a few sentences to the syria crisis in his address to the united nations general assembly this week and left new york on wednesday afternoon with no clear path to solve an issue that may well taint the legacy of how he handled the violent aftermath of the  arab spring mr kerrys demand on wednesday that all aircraft be grounded was part of an american effort to seek urgent change the attack on the humanitarian convoy a war crime followed an american airstrike on syrian forces that killed more than  people and which the pentagon quickly acknowledged was a mistake mr kerry angrily said wednesday that it was one thing to err in bombing people running around with guns on the ground and another to strike trucks in a convoy with big u n markings all over them  the eyewitnesses will tell you what happened mr kerry said in a direct confrontation with russia of a kind rarely seen at the security council since the cold war the place turned into hell and fighter jets were in the sky  with his new proposal mr kerry was also making what amounts to an   effort to test russian intentions in syria where the kremlin has increasingly engaged militarily to defend mr assad mr lavrovs spokeswoman maria zakharova who was accompanying him suggested after mr kerry spoke that the russians were not enthused by his ideas its about nothing she said that was a show  in private senior obama administration officials acknowledge that the very viability of the agreement with the russians is in question yet none of the players wanted to walk away and concede that the effort had failed mr kerry said the flight ban should be in key areas  american officials declined to specify them but they said he was referring to parts of northwest syria that are in dire need of aid including cities like aleppo where the opposition is prevalent the flight ban proposal will be discussed thursday at a meeting in new york of the international syrian support group a multinational body that is led by mr kerry and mr lavrov a more definitive russian response to the proposal may come then one of the crucial american tasks in those cities is to separate syrian opposition groups that the united states has supported and groups like the nusra front a qaeda affiliate that now calls itself the levant conquest front but fulfilling that task has proved far more difficult in aleppo for example than it seemed in the negotiating room in geneva while separating the   groups from their tactical alliances with the nusra front sounds logical for the rebels it would often mean abandoning their home territory leaving nusra unchallenged and opening their towns to an   bombing campaign others groups would have to fight nusra something they do not have the capability to do rebel leaders say washington is putting them into a classic bind the americans will not give them more support for fear of aiding nusra but without more weapons they cannot frontally fight nusra the most significant physical movement away from nusra by   groups in fact came when turkey offered them something in return real backing to take a border area from the islamic state that could one day be a safe place for the opposition to try to set up governance that offers a concrete alternative to mr assad when they did they were criticized for abandoning the aleppo front at a time of crisis the angry exchanges with russia at the united nations this week were prompted by the american conclusion that russian aircraft appeared to have been responsible for the assault on the aid convoy that is based on extensive satellite photography of the area and signals intelligence russia has denied responsibility but has offered varying explanations of what might have happened including the possibility that american aircraft bombed the convoy the united states has said none of its aircraft were involved the agreement between russia and the united states which went into effect sept  reduced the overall level of violence for a number of days despite violations in the divided city of aleppo and other parts of northern syria held by insurgents opposed to mr assad but the bombing of the united nations convoy happened after the syrian government said it considered the   to be over     and to have been unsuccessful mr kerry was undeterred we must move forward to try to immediately ground all aircraft flying in those key areas in order to   the situation and give a chance for humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded mr kerry told diplomats at the security council and if that happens theres a chance of giving credibility back to this process  the military logic of mr kerrys proposal is clear it would eliminate the risk that another aid convoy could be struck from the air because no aircraft could fly over the areas where the assistance was to be delivered the suggestion was carefully crafted diplomatically as well formally it applies to all aircraft that might fly over key areas including those flown by the united states and its partners but the intent is to prevent airstrikes by syrian and russian planes by urging that the step be taken immediately mr kerry was trying to avoid the need for   negotiations how can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity mr kerry said mr kerry called mr assad

gesture seemed to capture the spirit of this years festival where women of substance were much in evidence after years in which the festival was criticized for favoring male auteurs this year three female directors have strong films in competition including maren ade a german whose poignant comedy toni erdmann is seen as a likely contender for the top prize the palme dor jane campion is the only woman to have won that award in  for the piano  besides ms ade the other women with films in competition are the british director andrea arnold whose american honey a road movie starring shia labeouf and the   actress sasha lane has been receiving rave reviews along with some pans and the french   nicole garcia whose from the land of the moon stars marion cotillard as a troubled   frenchwoman in the s and has received mixed reviews its great there are three women directors here but theres still a lack of women making films ms arnold said after a news conference for american honey  lizzie francke a senior production and development executive at the british film institutes film fund echoed those sentiments its obvious that this year is a pretty good year she said but i also still feel its not good enough  she called cannes a venerable old mans festival but with a cutting edge  even if canness selection like the film industry itself hardly achieves gender parity theres been more conversation this year about the challenges of getting more women behind the camera and in front of it an issue that has heated up since the american civil liberties union last year called for an investigation into gender discrimination in hollywood hiring practices at an event where the luxury consortium kering gave an award to susan sarandon and geena davis  years after the release of thelma and louise pierre lescure president of the festival said that maybe in a few years there would be a woman in his place and in the place of thierry frmaux the festivals director the audience applauded i think more and more women starting production companies would help ms sarandon said adding hollywood isnt political one way or another     thats the good news and the bad news they just go with the money  ms davis who founded the geena davis institute on gender in media recalled how after thelma and louise came out in  the film was hailed as groundbreaking there were suggestions it might lead to more films   women that hasnt entirely happened i think we have to stop saying now this will change everything she said if you cant measure the change it hasnt happened  ms davis said that she advised studios and tv networks to make what youre already going to make but before you cast it just go through and change a bunch of names to female  ms foster whose money monster playing out of competition is her fourth feature as a director said that the technological changes of recent years like the advent of streaming services had made studio executives and producers far more   that she said led them to tend to take big bets on projects they hope will draw huge audiences rather than investing in smaller films by unknown directors including women before investing millions of dollars youre going to go with the guy who looks like you ms foster said at a kering women in motion talk she said that many scripts written by and for women were just not being produced its a financial issue its where art and commerce come together and commerce is winning she said it used to be that the investment was not as large so the risk was not as large  this week at cannes we do it together a nonprofit film company started last year by juliette binoche and others aimed at making work by women for film and television announced its first project together now a film of seven short episodes by different

needed someone who could play an adorable little secretary from nebraska with little white socks on and little dresses but who could also transform into a sophisticated beauty in cosmopolitan manhattan  ms stewart whose range far exceeds adorable elaborated on mr allens description the way he describes this lightness and this feminine nature it does suggest that its a little thoughtless she said at a lunch with the news media i think he has a tendency in interviews to say it was an idea and i had the idea and i wrote the idea and i hired the girl and she did it ms stewart added imitating mr allens cadences but theres more going on she said ms stewart also stars in personal shopper by the french director olivier assayas which screens in the competition here on tuesday vanessa

surveillance and the persecution of whistleblowers hit a point where theyve gone too far is the new cold war with russia looking less than ideal now how about the militarization of us police is it time to consider alternatives to that i hear you im with you lets build a movement together to end the madness of constantly overthrowing governments with bombs lets propose nonviolent alternatives to a culture gone mad with war lets end the mindset that creates war in the first place  we have opportunities as well as dangers a president trump is unpredictable he wants to proliferate nuclear weapons bomb people kill people stir up hatred of people and increase yet further military spending but he also said the new cold war was a bad idea he said he wanted to end nato not to mention nafta as well as breaking the habit of overthrowing countries left and right trump seems to immediately back off such positions under the slightest pressure will he adhere to them under massive pressure from across the political spectrum its worth a try  we have an opportunity to build a movement that includes a focus on and participation from refugeesimmigrants we have a chance to create opposition to racist wars and racism at home we may just discover that whats left of the us labor movement is suddenly more open to opposing wars environmental groups may find a willingness to oppose the worlds top destroyer of the environment the us military civil liberties groups may at long last be willing to take on the militarism that creates the atrocities they oppose we have to work for such a broader movement we have to build on the trend of protesting the national anthem and make it a trend of actively resisting the greatest purveyor of violence on earth i know youre feeling a little beat down at the moment you shouldnt you had a winning candidate in bernie sanders your party cheated him out of the nomination all that stuff you tell yourselves about encouraging demographic trends and the better positions of young people is all true you just looked for love in all the wrong places running an unpopular candidate in a broken election system is not the way to change the world even a working election system would not be the central means by which to improve anything theres no getting back the mountains of money and energy invested in this election but activism is an unlimited resource directing your energies now in more strategic directions can inspire others who in turn can reinspire you dear republicans your outsider is threatening insiderness hes got the same tribe of dc corporate lobbyists planning his nominations that hillary clinton had lined up for hers can we resist that trend can we insist that the wars be ended can those moments of offthecuff honesty about dinosaurs like nato be turned into actual action donald trump took a lot of heat for proposing to be fair to palestinians as well as israelis and he backed off fast can we encourage him to stand behind that initial inclination can we stop the transpacific partnership and end nafta as well we heard a million speeches about how bad nafta is how about actually ending it can we stop the looming war supplemental spending bill can we put a swift halt to efforts in congress to repeal the right to sue saudi arabia and other nations for their wars and lesser acts of terrorism how about all that well deserved disgust with the corporate media can we actually break up that cartel and allow opportunities for media entrepreneurs dear united states donald trump admitted we had a broken election system and for a while pretended that he would operate outside of it by funding his own campaign its time to actually fix it its time to end the system of legalized bribery fund elections make registration automatic make election day a holiday end gerrymandering eliminate the electoral college create the right to vote create the public handcounting of paper ballots at every polling place and create ranked choice voting as maine just did voter suppression efforts in this years elections should be prosecuted in each state and any indications of fraud in vote counting by machines should be investigated we should take the opportunity created by all the mccarthyist nonsense allegations of russian interference to get rid of unverifiable voting there are also areas in which localities and states as well as international organizations and alliances must now step up to take the lead first and foremost is investing in a serious effort to avoid climate catastrophe second is addressing inequality that has surpassed the middle ages both taxing the overclass and upholding the underclass must be pursued creatively mass incarceration and militarized police are problems that states can solve but we can advance a positive agenda across the board by understanding this election in the way that much of the world will understand it as a vote against endless war lets end the wars end the weapons dealing close the bases and cut the  trillion a year going into the military hell why not demand that a businessman president for the first time ever audit the pentagon and find out what its spending money on dear world we apologize for having elected president trump as well as for nearly electing president clinton many of you believe we defeated the representative of the enlightenment in favor of the sexist racist buffoon this may be a good thing or at least it may be preferable to your eightyearlong delusion that president obama was a man of peace and justice i hate to break it to you but the united states government has been intent on dominating the rest of you since the day it was formed if electing an obnoxious president helps you understand that so much the better stop

       " ' who studied unusual states of matter win nobel prize in physics  the new york times three physicists born in britain but now working in the united states were awarded the nobel prize in physics on tuesday for research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states including superconductors superfluids and thin magnetic films david j thouless of the university of washington was awarded half of the prize of  million swedish kronor or about   while f duncan m haldane of princeton university and j michael kosterlitz of brown university shared the other half the scientists relied on advanced mathematical models to study theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter in the words of the royal swedish academy of sciences in stockholm their studies may have major applications in electronics materials science and computing in an email michael s turner a physicist at the university of chicago described the work as truly transformational with   consequences both practical and fundamental  the three laureates sought to understand matter that is so cold or so thin that weird quantum effects overpower the random atomic jostling that dominates ordinary existence superconductivity in which all electrical resistance vanishes in matter is one example of such an effect dr thouless and dr kosterlitz worked together at the university of birmingham in the s to investigate what happens when   films of matter shift from one exotic phase like superconductivity to another the key to their success was something called topology a branch of mathematics focused on the fundamental shapes of things at the nobel news conference in stockholm thors hans hansson a member of the nobel physics committee tried to illustrate topology by holding up a cinnamon bun a bagel and a pretzel to a topologist he said the only difference between them is the number of holes as opposed to the characteristics an average person might notice like saltiness or sweetness there is no such thing as half a hole the topologist would note and the number of holes only changes stepwise in integers likewise the macroscopic properties of exotic matter change in stepwise quantum leaps if the materials involved are thin or small enough that their behavior is determined by the strange rules that govern the behavior of atoms an example is the quantum hall effect in which the electrical resistance of a thin film changes in stepwise fashion in  dr thouless was able to link these changes mathematically to the   chern numbers     after the mathematician   chern     that characterize topological shapes dr haldane used a similar technique to analyze the properties of chains of atoms so skinny that they could be considered   threads someday they may be the basis of a new kind of computer in the last decade this work has led to the development of materials called topological insulators which conduct electricity on their surfaces but not inside they have ignited a firestorm of research and although applications are still yet to come i believe its only a matter of time before their research leads to advances as unimaginable to us now as lasers and computer chips were a hundred years ago said laura h greene   of the american physical society dr thouless  was born in bearsden scotland was an undergraduate at cambridge university and received a ph d in  from cornell from  to  he taught mathematical physics at the university of birmingham in england where he collaborated with dr kosterlitz in  he joined the university of washington in seattle where he is now an emeritus professor dr haldane  was born in london he received his ph d from cambridge where he was also an undergraduate in  he worked at the institut   in grenoble france the university of southern california bell laboratories and the university of california san diego before joining the princeton faculty in  dr kosterlitz  was born in aberdeen scotland and received his doctorate in   physics from oxford university in  he has worked at the university of birmingham the institute of theoretical physics in turin italy and cornell princeton bell laboratories and harvard i was very surprised and very gratified dr haldane whom the nobel committee reached by phone tuesday morning told reporters at the news conference in stockholm the work was a long time ago but its only now that a lot of tremendous new discoveries are based on this original work and have extended it  dr kosterlitz told the associated press that he had gotten the news while heading to lunch in helsinki finland where he is a visiting professor at aalto university im a little bit dazzled he said im still trying to take it in  he said that he was in his s

       " 'mcmaster gave susan rice continued access to classified info she still has clearance this very important scandal is unfolding before us it has many many  legs  with different obama administration officials involved don t count on the main stream media to fill you in this is a big dealandrew mccarthy said it best the nationalsecurity adviser is not an investigator she is a white house staffer the president s staff is a consumer of intelligence not a generator or collector of it if susan rice was unmasking americans it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on american interests it was to fulfill a political desire based on democraticparty interests circa news has been uncovering disturbing information regarding the  unmasking  of american citizens and how obama provided a way for the unmasking to go  unfettered  susan rice and samantha power both have  unfettered access  to classified material and likely unmasked many in government sara carter reports below on hr mcmaster s involvement in this unmaskingalmost one month after it was disclosed that former president obama s national security adviser susan rice was unmasking members of president trump s team and other americans trump s own national security adviser hr mcmaster sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her  needtoknow  requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure circa has confirmedthe undated and unclassified letter from mcmaster was sent in the mail to rice s home during the last week of april trump was not aware of the letter or mcmaster s decision according to two senior west wing officials and an intelligence official who spoke to circa on condition that they not be named this is the letter from mcmaster to rice names phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred i hereby waive the requirement that you must have a  needtoknow  to access any classified information contained in items you  originated reviewed signed or received while serving  as national security adviser  the letter said the letter also states that the  nsc will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information circa revealed in march that during president obama s tenure top aides   including rice former cia director john brennan and former attorney general loretta lynch   routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the national security agency s incidental intercepts of americans abroad they were doing so by taking advantage of rules obama relaxed starting in  to help the government better fight terrorism espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats according to documents obtained by circain june the house intelligence committee subpoenaed rice as part of the committee s larger investigation into the unmasking of americans under the obama administration rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committeeunder the law and under certain conditions it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information and their  need to know  is waived under  executive order  section  access by historical researchers and certain former government personnel  but the white house officials told circa that under the current congressional investigation and given president trump s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked rice s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation rice and brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of americans in nsasourced intelligence reports but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper former us ambassador to the united nations samantha power also has legal authority to unmask officialsin a june tweet trump called the revelation that rice and other obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the  big story  the  unmasking and surveillance  that took place during the obama administration basically this letter which was signed in the last week of april undercuts the president s assertion that susan rice s unmasking activity was inappropriate in essence anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information  said a senior west wing official who was shown the document by circa and verified its authenticity  in fact they would have their security clearance and right to  needtoknow  stripped the point is is that it lowers the bar for her  the senior west wing official said this memo mcmaster sent to rice makes it so that she doesn t have to prove a continuing  needtoknow  to have access to classified information and in effect is a white house pardon of susan rice and could be used by other obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense  the official addedremember that rice recently lied again about the unmasking   she did it on national tvif the obama administration was good at anything it was good at lying to hijack the narrativeremember when susan rice lied after benghazi it is what she does so well flash forward to the latest hot water she s in and it s hard to tell what she d want us believe this time which should we believe what she said to andrea mitchell or to judy woodruffsusan rice appeared on andrea mitchell she claimed she didn t leak  nothing to nobody did you catch that double negativethere might be more to that because she s using words in the two sentences very carefully check it outsusan rice version onewatch susan rice insists  i leaked nothing to nobody  httpstcokasbuvjdn  msnbc msnbc april  susan rice version two i know nothing about this i was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that count today what she says is a lie but who is surprised by this we know that susan rice lied  times on  different morning shows the morning after benghazi why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including obamasusan rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now she claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it yes red flags are everywhere on this the reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the trump presidency and embarrass himthe

their  progressive values  have progressed far beyond what used to be considered as liberal  and into the realm of political fascism and marxiststyle identity politics the liberal reaction to the us

result has accentuated this phenomenon bringing many hardcore radical campus political ideologies out of their academic shells and into the open in all of their ugliness some university heads around

leaping at full speed and jumpkicking them directly in the screen news november   vol  issue   politics  election  washingtonsaying the circumstances of this years presidential race made the upgrade necessary election commissions throughout the country were reportedly working to install new heavyduty voting machines this week that will allow americans to physically take out their frustrations on the devices before casting their votes according to premier election solutions the manufacturer of the new citadel electronic voting machine each unit features an easytonavigate interface keeps accurate and secure tallies of votes and is constructed with durable kevlar buttons a shatterresistant plexiglas screen and a reinforced titanium housing ensuring the devices are able to endure sustained blunt force trauma from voters fists and elbows as well as repeated puncturing attempts from sharp objects wielded by exasperated citizens these new voting machines were designed specifically with the  election in mind and have been engineered to withstand everything the nations voters will bring at them on election day said company spokesperson stephen dunn who also noted that the units teflon coating makes it easy to wipe down all the sweat and saliva that will accumulate on their surface when they are being repeatedly pummeled in fits of anger when  months of disgust finally culminate inside the nations voting booths these machines will be able to absorb every punch kick and knee drop citizens can dish out while still reliably tabulating totals for all local state and national races like millions of other americans i know that ill be ready to unload my pentup rage next tuesday dunn added and our machines will be ready too according to dunn the citadel underwent numerous revisions during testing as a series of early designs proved incapable of withstanding voters increasing level of aggravation as the election progressed engineers are said to have quickly pulled their prototypes from preliminary field tests during the virginia and minnesota primaries upon learning the devices original plastic housing was splintering to pieces following sharp headbutts from as few as three successive voters additionally internal modifications were reportedly made after super tuesday to more securely solder the processor and wiring into place so the unit would maintain functionality each time it was thrown to the ground by a redfaced screaming voter and continuously kicked for  minutes straight in a later trial during the wisconsin primary when the republican field had been effectively whittled down to just ted cruz and donald trump dunn said the design team came up with the idea to attach an aluminum baseball bat to the side of the machine with a steel cord noting that if they didnt provide voters with a convenient weapon they would physically rip the units legs off and beat it with those to the point of exhaustion our test models were really pushed to their physical limits during the new jersey primary in june when it was more or less clear that the country would be left with hillary clinton and donald trump as its two choices for president said dunn explaining that the devices had to survive allout abusive barrages from every voter who entered their testing precincts in passaic county thankfully we had incorporated militarygrade armor plating into the machines by that point which proved able to sustain everything from being repeatedly smashed up against a cinderblock gymnasium wall to being dragged up and then pushed down flights of church basement stairs several times in a row of course that was the night we learned we needed to make the touchscreen bulletproof though dunn continued according to poll workers excitement about the new machines appears to have increased voter turnout in the general election with early voting up by as much as  percent in states where the units have already been installed forcing many polling places to institute time limits on how long voters can batter stomp on and bite the units in raving bouts of hysterics it was nice to get in there and finally cast my ballot said yearold gordon mulner an early voter in fredericksburg va panting heavily as he wiped away the sheen of sweat from his brow with his raw bleeding knuckles i had to wait in line a little while but it was worth it it felt good to make my voice heard i think i broke my hand he added at press time election officials were scrambling to chain the machines to precinct walls as it became

said nguyen van phu  who has spent six years working on the boats that chug between the bay s spectacular stone towers  if they stopped coming it would be a big problem if not a disaster  the number of chinese tourists in vietnam has surged this year just one sign of the growing economic ties between two longtime enemies chinese investment in vietnam is also increasing rapidly as is trade between the two countries but while tourists trade and investment are being welcomed they also present a challenge for a fiercely independent country like vietnam which has been wary of china s growing influence in the region  the rising economic dependence on china makes it more difficult for vietnam to decide how far to confront china on the south china sea  said nguyen khac giang a researcher at the vietnam economics and policy research institution  vietnam would suffer far more than china economically in the event of political instability given its smaller size he said china exports more goods to vietnam than any other country in southeast asia sending textiles to be made into shirts and sneakers and electronic components for mobile phones and large flatpanel displays those completed products are exported around the world as well as back to china     vietnam also makes electronics components for factories in china and exports computers for chinese consumers manufacturers see vietnam as an attractive base with wages as little as a third of those in coastal regions of china according to employment consultants and while proximity has historically been a source of friction between the two countries  they fought a border war as recently as  and armed clashes flared for years afterwards  for manufacturers it s a boon  we strategically invested in vietnam because of its

southeast asia it has drawn beijing s ire its growing defense links to the united states japan and india also make china suspicious the vietnamese government has also had to contend with public pressure at home a row over chinese oil drilling in disputed waters in the south china sea in  sparked antichina riots in vietnam in which foreign factories thought to be chinese were set on fire

shecan then apply for a parent to obtain a visa and green card and eventually enter the united states legallyin order to apply for such an option the parent of a socalled anchor baby would need to do all of the followingif a person has lived in the united states unlawfully for a period of more than  days but less than one year there is an automatic threeyear bar on that person ever reentering the united states  and thats before any wait time for a visa so thats a minimum of  years for the child to mature plus the threeyear waitand for the vast majority of these parents a longer wait alsoapplies if a person has lived in the united states illegally for a year or more there is a year ban on that person reentering the united states so in that case there would be the year wait for the child to mature to adulthood plus the year waitall told the parents of the socalled anchor baby face a toyear wait to even enter the united states much less obtain a visa and green card or become a citizenwant proofsee sections ai and  aii of the immigration and nationality act ina or spend an afternoon in your nearest severely backlogged immigration courtimmigration court backlog grows to more than  casesimmigration courts routinely reject claims that an undocumented parent must remain in the united states to care for a us citizen child the main but rarelegal exceptions are for children who are so seriously ill or profoundly disabled that one parent must care for them fulltime or for a child in need of medical care unavailable in their parents home countrythese parents are given something called humanitarian parole chen explained and this isvery rarely applied to people already living in the united states illegally it is more often given to the parents of say an afghan war burn victim who want to accompany their child to the united states for medical care and even then humanitarian parole is generally granted for limited period of timealternatively these parents can apply for something even more rare an extreme hardship exception according to deborah anker a clinical professor of law and director of the harvard university law schools immigration and refugee clinical programvery rarely they can apply for a waiver that may allow them to reenter the united states sooner anker said but if that request is denied there is no form of appeal available decisions are finalyes it is true that some undocumented immigrants come to the united states and have children with or perhaps even because of the mistaken belief that this will strengthen a legal bid to remain in the united states mistaken beliefs have spurred previous surges in illegal immigration  including last yearsand it is true that some people  such as breastfeeding mothers children brought to the united states illegally as children and others  have benefited from the immigration system equivalent of proprietorial discretion known as deferred actionbut with the exception of anobama administration program known as daca limited to an estimated  million young adults brought to the united states illegally as children and a second programcurrently blocked by a federal courtthat would have granted deferred action to another  people mostly the parents of those eligible for daca deferred actions typically come with a short and limited timeline they also do not include a pathway to a visa or legal work in the united states and these programs did not exist when the concept of ananchor baby was politically popularized so it becomes harder to accept the idea thathaving an anchor baby was the express goal ofmany people immigrating illegallyits also important to note that as of august  only about  daca applications had been approved according to a pew research center analysis of federal data andeven these applicants must wait until their st birthday to begin the lengthy process described above to attempt to help an undocumented parent and attempt is the key word hereand if youre still skeptical heres the real proof that having a baby in the united states does little to help an undocumented parent remain in the united states theres thisin  there were at least  children in state custody or foster care because an undocumented parent or parents has been deported according to a study released by the applied research center a new yorkbased think tank that focuses on racial and social justice issues some estimates put that figure even higher today immigration and customs enforcement sent mandatory reports to the senate that among other things revealed that during  the agency deported  people who told federal authorities they have one or more us citizen childreneach of these children and their parents certainly know the anchor baby is not real',\n",

decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system   hillary clinton the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood  with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros  the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending

let himself float limp as kelp mr harris a former army medic gazed through a diving mask at a manta ray the size of a hang glider doing slow somersaults above shifting schools of silver fish a   whale shark brushed silently by inches from his face its broad spotted back taking up his entire view immersed in the moment he forgot about the world this is not a weekend hobby it is part of his therapy for the   stress disorder he has been grappling with after his tours in iraq and like mr harris more veterans are turning to these sorts of    treatment the broad acceptance of ptsd after the wars in iraq and afghanistan has posed an unexpected challenge acknowledging ptsd has only spurred a   debate over the best way to treat it traditional medical approaches generally rely on drugs and controlled   of trauma called exposure therapy but this combination has proved so unpopular that many veterans quit before finishing or avoid it altogether this has given rise to hundreds of small nonprofits across the country that offer alternatives therapeutic fishing rafting and backpacking trips horse riding combat yoga dogs art collectives dolphin swims sweat lodge vision quests and parrot husbandry centers among many many others a decade ago mainstream psychiatry often dismissed these therapies but now as new studies suggest that things like yoga and interacting with animals can be as beneficial as drugs in reducing depression and anxiety without side effects or stigma a growing number of psychotherapists are building them into treatment plans it is not hard to find veterans who had bad experiences with traditional treatment mike hilliard the dive master who leads swims in the georgia aquariums huge tank fought depression and anger after two combat tours including a stint in iraq in which he was shot in the head treatment had always been someone telling me i was dysfunctional and giving me a bunch of pills i became more withdrawn to the point where i was considering ending it all said mr hilliard a former army sergeant he repeatedly dropped out of care and found nothing that really helped until he tried scuba diving as soon as i was underwater everything went quiet seeing the fish hearing the ocean     there is a complete innocence about it there are no bad memories in the water everything just wants to live it made me want to live again  he now guides groups sent by the military and the department of veterans affairs on a similar journey in the aquarium several times a week its not just a thank you for your service thing he told a group on a recent morning moments before plunging in with the sea life this is a real tool you can use to rebuild your life  the crush of veterans seeking treatment beyond drugs and exposure therapy has pushed psychologists to try to scientifically evaluate programs that were once largely dismissed as field trips but many psychiatrists are troubled by a lack of hard evidence supporting alternative therapies interest has just exploded lt col gary wynn a psychiatrist who teaches at the uniformed services university of the health sciences the militarys medical school i work with the v a and the military there is no one who thinks this is just silly alternative medicine stuff anymore  but he cautioned evidence of real benefit is in many cases still often slim or nonexistent in part because of a lack of funding for studies and in part because alternative therapies are harder to assess than drugs if im studying the benefits of fly fishing do i control for the number of fish people caught or for the weather he said there is still a lot of work to be done on this  ptsd was not formally recognized until  in the relatively young field people are still figuring out the best ways to treat it said dr bessel van der kolk a   psychiatrist and a   author who helped get the disorder recognized the consensus seems to be shifting away from reflexively medicating patients and toward complementing psychotherapy with things like yoga he said in the beginning i was very   on drugs i did a lot of the early studies for drugs for ptsd but we very quickly realized they dont work very well he said every veteran since homer has been doping himself up to keep his issues under wraps but it doesnt help process the trauma  in the s dr van der kolk published one of the first studies about the effects of yoga on ptsd it had very good results after eight weeks six months the positive effects are still there he said he has since made yoga a core part of his practice long before medical researchers began trying to document benefits veterans sought out the healing potential of the world beyond the doctors office the first person  to walk the entire appalachian trail earl shaffer had just come home from world war ii and told friends he needed to walk the army out of my system both mentally and physically  after vietnam hundreds of veterans sought refuge in the wilderness most of my work is being driven by the veterans said daniel libby a   psychologist who teaches yoga at a veterans center in oakland calif run by the department of veterans affairs they dont want to be on medications yoga offers a therapy that is   you dont have to rely on the medical system  in  mr libby surveyed the departments health system and found that  percent of hospitals offered yoga now he estimates that it is more than  percent dr barbara rothbaum a psychologist at emory university who runs an intensive   ptsd treatment program complements her traditional therapies with alternative ones she recently helped compile a national academy of sciences report on therapies for ptsd we met a lot of   clinicians around the country creating programs with equine therapy or wilderness therapy or whatever and there was no way to know if any of it worked she said because of that we couldnt recommend it  dr rothbaum relies on exposure therapy in her clinic at the same time though she has added yoga and meditation to help patients relax its not a core treatment but its a life skill that helps maintain the gains she said she also sends patients to places like the georgia aquarium to challenge them to overcome fears and build new experiences that put traumatic memories in perspective after  minutes mr harris the former army medic emerged from the water with a broad grin amazing he said when mr harris got out of the army he went to the department of veterans affairs several times for therapy and medication but always dropped out in frustration and threw his pills away i didnt want to have to take meds ive always been a cornerstone helping other people he said i guess i was mad at myself  but nightmares and violent outbursts grew worse one day he blew up at his sister over a vacuum cleaner cord left out in a hallway and slapped her shocked at his actions he vowed to give therapy another try he now does a combination of traditional exposure therapy and medication but also meditation and yoga which he said makes you feel better all day  swimming with the sharks to him was more than a field trip its relaxing sure it made me feel great but its also kind of scary with those big sharks he said and part of therapy is doing what you have been avoiding overcoming your fears ',\n",

illegal immigration here is a look at what it would take to accomplish each of the ten goals build a wall on the southern border trump has the legal authorization to build fences under the secure fence act passed in  but congress would have to approve considerably more funding to wall off the entire southern border which spans nearly  miles there are also logistical challenges some areas of the border are privately owned and the geography of some stretches would make construction extremely difficult trump previously said he would make mexico pay for the wall but that policy is not included on his postelection web site   end catchandrelease to end the practice known as catch and release under which immigrants are released pending court hearings trump could unilaterally shift policies but full implementation would require significantly more detention space to hold migrants before they can see a judge there is currently a case backlog in us immigration courts and recent court decisions prohibit him from detaining children with their parents for longer than  days  zero tolerance for criminal aliens the obama administration currently prioritizes immigrants convicted of serious crimes for deportation but trump could try to expand the definition of who is classified as a criminal alien or attempt to speed up removals of people who have been ordered deported in any case more funding for courts and personnel involved in apprehensions would likely be necessary  blocking funding for sanctuary cities trump has threatened to cut off funding for socalled sanctuary cities such as chicago and los angeles where local law enforcement refuse to report undocumented immigrants they encounter to federal authorities while trump has the authority to cut some kinds of funding to the cities mayors of those cities have said they will not be pressured to report migrants to federal agents  cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws trump has the authority to undo executive orders like daca which has provided temporary relief from deportation to more than  immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children enforcing all immigration laws would require trump to deport an estimated  million immigrants living illegally in the united states that would require large increases in funding from congress to grow the current workforce of immigration agents and judges to be able to lawfully handle  million deportations locating so many immigrants many in the country for years with deep family ties would be logistically challenging and could spark public backlash  suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur similar to the muslim ban trump proposed during his campaign this policy would be aimed at visa seekers from wartorn countries such as syria and iraq where many refugees and asylum seekers have sought to escape under current law trump could unilaterally suspend visas for any individuals or groups or people deemed detrimental to the interests of the united states the policy could face challenges in court however if it appears to discriminate against any one religion ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported the obama administration has wrestled with the issue of forcing recalcitrant countries to take back people the united states is seeking to deport trump could ramp up diplomatic pressure on countries such as china the country that has refused to repatriate the largest number of people ordered deported from the united states but that could have wider diplomatic ramifications finally complete the biometric entryexit visa tracking system although mandated by law since bill clinton was president the united states has yet to develop a system to track foreign visitors and determine if they leave the country when their visas expire getting a program up and running would require significant funding to collect and store biometric data such as fingerprints for every visa holder who enters and leaves the united states and some experts have said the system is not practical  turn off the jobs and benefits magnet trump would need congressional approval to mandate a national database known as everify that allows employers to check the immigration status of potential hires until such a system is in place it is difficult to penalize employers who unknowingly hire undocumented immigrants using fake social security numbers   reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of america and its workers the department of labor the department of homeland security and the justice department could increase investigations of employers suspected of abusing visa programs such as hb that allow companies to hire foreign workers often for a lower cost than what they would pay americans but trump could face backlash from industries that rely on the program including the technology sector if he goes too far in revoking visas  ',\n",

to mow there may be some time to take a break and thats somewhat true but not really winter is actually one of the busiest times of year in addition to taking care of the animals clearing snow and keeping things running you need to plan and prep for the next year winter appears to be a time of sleep and relaxing by the fire but for a homesteader there is no such thing if you have cows to milk and chickens to feed then you still have to take care of that then there are all of the other tasks that you have to do clearing the roof bringing in firewood making impromptu repairs winter is a great time of the year to make a plan for what you need to do in the spring summer and fall to make your homestead successful weve put together a calendar of things to do in the winter to help make your homestead successful all year round check your stockpile winter is a great time to check your stockpile for several reasons but the primary reason that were adding it to the calendar is so that you can decide what to plant in the spring if youre running out of green beans but still have a ton of corn you can adjust your crops accordingly plant more beans and less corn the same thing goes for canned meals and condiments if youve just about eaten all of your beef stew and salsa but still have a ton of chicken soup left adjust accordingly you can also determine whether youre best using your crops say you had a bumper crop of apples and made pie filling applesauce apple cider vinegar  and apple butter now youre out of pie filling but still have  quarts of applesauce it seems like you may want to adjust how you use your apples next year make a chart and record your findings so that you can compare to last year and make your adjustments you dont want to use your entire stockpile its good to have enough for a couple of years but you dont want to can  months worth of apple butter and  years worth of okra especially two years in a row concentrate on your herbswinter crops i dont know about you but i love herbs theyre great for adding flavor and for using medicinally since theyre easy to grow inside  you can grow them year round since youre likely slam busy all summer and fall wait until winter to harvest and store your herbs this is a good time to make your essential oils and medicinal blends  too if you live in a moderate climate you may be able to grow some winter crops such as garlic kale carrots and potatoes during the winter theyre easy to grow and wont take up hardly any time search the internet for crops that will grow in the winter according to your zone  there are also early spring edibles that you can start growing and have ready to eat while youre waiting on those peppers and tomatoes to grow start your seeds if you live in a zone where you have short summers and you want to grow crops that have a long growing period start them inside as early as february that way youll have healthy seedlings or young plants to transplant when the weather warms up your garden will have a great start before the snow is even off the ground make a todo list for the coming months plan your summer sit down and make charts of what youre going to plant how much of it youre going to plant and where youre going to plant it keep in mind soil types and compatible plants when youre making your chart think about your animals do you want to breed do you need more eggs did you put back enough meat this year are your chickens cramped and need a new coup how about the barn  does it need repairs is the tractor running rough do you need any new equipment make a list by month of all these projects that you need to address plan your expenses now that youve sat down and planned your crops and equipment repairs and made a list of other things that you do then plan how much youre going to need to spend versus when youll need it and when youll have the money to do it try to project any equipment replacements or repairs that youll need too remember to allow for any unexpected expenses you dont have to stop with just the next year do a fiveyear plan then adjust as needed keep adding a year every winter this will really help keep you on track as long as you actually refer back to the list and follow it as much as possible make syrup if you live in an area where you have birch or maple trees late winter is when you can gather the sap from the trees and make your syrup for the year just fyi its a bit of work to make but its free and you can sell it for a great profit thats assuming your family doesnt make you keep it do all of the inhouse repairs think about those creaky stairs unpainted rooms loose carpets and wobbly stools that youve been meaning to fix all summer nows a great time to get all of that stuff done so that you can check it off the list video first seen on tacticalintelligence  help your animals adapt winter affects different animals in different ways chickens will likely slow down production when the weather changes you can head this off a bit by making sure that theyre snug and warm but make sure that the coop stays wellventilated keeping your hens happy will make your breakfast a happy event too cows and horses on the other hand may need to be fed more so that they have enough energy to stay warm and in the case of cows keep producing quality milk if youre new to homesteading study up on your animals before winter so that youll know what to do to keep your animals safe and healthy winter is definitely a bit slower than the rest of the year but there are plenty of things that you can do to maintain and improve your farm relaxing a bit isnt a bad thing either  you work your buns off the rest of the year so give your brain and your body a break have some family time farms are a ton of work and though we all squeeze in together time while we work cleaning out the chicken coop together just isnt the same as picking up a redbox or heading out for pizza and an evening of fun theres so much work to be done in the other months that its easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and forget to have some fun nows your chance educate yourself winter is a great time to use your mind instead of your back

buy some books and magazines to get some new ideas about how to move your farm forward think about planting guides new equipment new prepping ideas or ways to help keep your animals healthy naturally another good subject to study up on is the plants that youre growing if you dont know all about each plant that you grow take this time to learn not all plants like the same types of soil some like rich loamy soil some like sandy soil some grow great next to each other and others such as tomatoes and potatoes shouldnt be grown together just knowing these small facts will increase your yield and

joining the european union could be at stake meeting in brussels secretary of state john kerry and european union foreign ministers called on mr erdogan to show restraint in the wake of the failed coup even as he continued to round up political opponents and as turkey debated whether it should reinstate the death penalty to deal with the plotters obviously nato also has a requirement with respect to democracy and nato will indeed measure very carefully what is happening mr kerry said and my hope is that turkey is going to move in ways that do respect what they have said to me many times is the bedrock of their country  on monday natos secretary general jens stoltenberg condemned the coup attempt but added being part of a unique community of values it is essential for turkey like all other allies to ensure full respect for democracy and its institutions the constitutional order the rule of law and fundamental freedoms  and the european unions foreign policy chief federica

detained more than   military personnel since an attempted coup friday night and there are signs he is using the moment to widen a crackdown on perceived enemies turkey has been a crucial ally in the

must first meet benchmarks on protecting freedoms and upholding the rule of law the flow of migrants across the aegean sea to the european union has slowed to a trickle since leaders of the bloc and the government in ankara reached a deal this year that gives funds to aid organizations in turkey along with other concessions but the scale of the crackdown in the wake of the attempted coup in turkey has rattled western leaders alongside the members of the military the turkish government also dismissed thousands of judges who seemingly played no role in the military revolt obviously a lot of people have been arrested and arrested very quickly mr kerry said appearing to echo allegations by some europeans that the turkish authorities had prepared lists of people for reprisals even before the coup i think the level of vigilance and scrutiny is obviously going to be significant in the days ahead and well work very closely and hopefully we can work in a constructive way that prevents a backsliding and that is our hope  mr erdogan has urged the united states to extradite one of his former allies the cleric fethullah gulen to turkey mr erdogan has accused mr gulen of inspiring the coup attempt which mr gulen has denied i made it clear to the foreign minister there is indeed a very formal process for that and there has to be a formal extradition request submitted through the appropriate channels legal channels mr kerry said of his turkish counterpart adding that he had urged the turkish authorities to send us evidence not allegations  separately the united states ambassador to turkey john r bass denounced as categorically untrue speculation that the united states in some way supported the coup attempt  as american officials sought to manage the situation in

of a jewish homeland in the middle east triggering a process that would culminate in the creation of israel  and with it one of the world s most intractable conflicts on thursday british and israeli leaders commemorated the centenary of that statement known as the balfour declaration after the foreign minister who penned it with a banquet in the gilded halls of london s lancaster house mansion but as prime minister theresa may and israel s benjamin netanyahu dine protesters gathered to demand that britain acknowledge the suffering they say the declaration has caused to palestinian people and recognize their claim to statehood   the reason it is getting so much attention is because the conflict which it launched  is still very much in existence and there is a sense particularly on the palestinian side of continuing injustice  said ian black an academic at the london school of economics  it really is an issue which is alive and toxic and bitterly divisive  while israel reveres arthur balfour naming streets and a tel aviv school after him palestinians decry his declaration as a promise by britain to hand over land it did not own the contested declaration is at the root of the israelipalestinian territorial conflict which after several wars and  decades of international diplomacy remains unsettled marches each drawing about  demonstrators were held in the west bank cities of ramallah and nablus and in gaza a modest turnout for political protests in those areas protesters waved palestinian flags and held banners demanding britain rectify its  historical sin  in

  as his fundamental vision of peaceful coexistence has not yet been fulfilled  may said at the dinner according to a copy of her speech distributed by her office  i believe it demands of us today a renewed resolve to support a lasting peace that is in the interests of both israelis and palestinians   and in the interests of us all  britain held palestine which had been under ottoman turkish rule from  until after the end of world war two israel declared independence in  at the end of british mandatory rule and after the un general assembly voted in  in favor of a plan rejected by palestinian

seeking to establish an independent state in territories captured by israel in the  middle east war thursday s commemoration culminating in the dinner hosted by descendants of balfour and of the recipient of his declaration jewish community leader walter rothschild required britain to strike a delicate diplomatic balance britain regards israel as a close and important ally and supports international efforts to find a peaceful solution that results in separate israeli and palestinian states attempting to strike the right balance johnson on monday praised the declaration for helping to create a  great nation  but he also said the spirit of the declaration had not been fully realized he was referring to a clause in the document which said nothing should prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonjewish communities israel has traditionally focused less on that clause and more on the declaration s landmark endorsement of a jewish homeland and plans to celebrate the anniversary the israeli parliament will hold a special commemorative session next week   while the state would not have arisen without settlement sacrifice and a willingness to fight for it the international impetus was undoubtedly the balfour declaration  netanyahu told a meeting of his cabinet ahead of his visit to london israel does not oppose international efforts to make peace but says  as do international sponsors  that a solution cannot be imposed and should stem from talks between the two parties some arab lawmakers in the israeli parliament said they would boycott the celebrations and protests were planned across several days in london by organizations pledging solidarity with the palestinians earlier this week abbas used an article in britain s guardian newspaper to reiterate calls for the british government to acknowledge the declaration as a mistake  the creation of a homeland for one people resulted in the dispossession and continuing persecution of another   now a deep imbalance between occupier and occupied  he wrote   the balance must be redressed and britain bears a great deal of responsibility in leading the way  britain has refused palestinian

       " 'wells fargo workers claim retaliation for playing by the rules  the new york times at least   wells fargo employees have been fired for ethics violations like setting up illicit accounts without customers knowledge to meet sales targets now theres another group of aggrieved wells fargo workers people who say they were fired or demoted for staying honest and falling short of sales goals they say were unrealistic that second group of workers who claim that they played by the rules and were punished for it are starting to coalesce around two lawsuits that were just filed and that seek   status the first was filed in los angeles last week by former wells fargo workers who say that while their colleagues created unauthorized accounts to meet   quotas they were penalized or terminated for refusing to do the same the banks chief executive john stumpf has often stated his goal that each wells customer should have at least eight accounts with the company that aggressive target has made the banks stock a darling on wall street the lawsuit notes on monday a federal lawsuit with analogous claims was filed in the united states district court for the central district of california seeking to create a class of current and former wells employees across the country who had similar experiences these are the people who have been left holding the bag said jonathan delshad the lawyer representing the workers in both suits it was a revolving door if you werent willing to engage in these types of illegal practices they just booted you out the door and replaced you  in a statement on monday wells fargo said we disagree with the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously defend against the misrepresentations it contains about wells fargo and all of the wells fargo team members whose careers have been built on doing the right thing by our customers every day  one former employee planning to join the lawsuit is dennis russell  who said he was fired in  after a   career as a telephone banker at wells fargos call center in orange county calif mr russell handled incoming customer service calls and was expected to refer  percent of his callers to a sales representative for additional product sales he said but the customers mr russell spoke with were usually in dire financial shape he said in a telephone interview on monday looking at their accounts he could see mortgages in foreclosure credit cards in collections and cars being repossessed for overdue loan payments the people calling didnt have assets to speak of mr russell said what products could you possibly offer them in a legitimate way the two fresh lawsuits echo many of the allegations in a  lawsuit filed by the los angeles city attorneys office wells fargo settled the case this month agreeing to pay  million in fines including a  million penalty levied by the consumer financial protection bureau the federal watchdog agency that conducted its own investigation but some wells fargo employees tried years earlier to sound the alarm     with personally disastrous results yesenia guitron a former banker sued wells fargo in      three years earlier than the bank has admitted it knew about the sham accounts ms guitron became alarmed when two months into her job at wells fargo she noticed that a fellow banker at the companys st helena calif branch was opening and closing customers accounts without their permission intense sales pressure and unrealistic quotas drove employees to falsify documents and game the system to meet their sales goals she wrote in her legal filing ms guitron said she did everything the company had taught employees to do to report such misconduct internally she told her manager about her concerns she called wells fargos ethics hotline when those steps yielded no results she went up the chain contacting a human resources representative and the banks regional manager wells fargos response after months of what ms guitron described as retaliatory harassment she was called into a meeting and told she was being fired for insubordination in  the united states district court for the northern district of california sided with wells fargo and ruled that even if its sales targets were unreasonable the bank had the right to use them as an employment yardstick ms guitron appealed the decision and lost again     leaving her with a bill for more than   in court costs she put her neck on the line and they punished her  said yosef peretz the lawyer who represented ms guitron shes a single mom with two kids barely making it and her reputation was poisoned no one would hire her  ms guitron left the banking industry and now works in property management he said christopher johnson  a plaintiff in the lawsuit filed on monday said he hesitated to get involved in the legal case because it brought back memories of a very dark time in my life  he was fired in  after working for wells fargo for five months in trainings the company repeatedly emphasized the importance of its ethics code and urged employees to call its confidential hotline if they observed anything inappropriate mr johnson said but just two weeks after he started working as a business banker in a wells fargo branch in malibu calif his manager began pressuring him to open accounts for his friends and family     with or without their knowledge when he refused he was criticized for not being a team player mr johnson soon learned that his colleagues routinely opened unauthorized accounts for customers who they thought wouldnt notice like elderly clients or those who didnt speak english well disturbed by this practice he did as he was instructed during training and called the companys ethics hotline three days later he was fired for not meeting expectations he said broke mr johnson was evicted from his house and spent the next seven months living out of his truck he put all of his possessions in a storage unit then lost them to auction when he was unable to pay the storage bill mr johnson who now works as a writer said he had stepped forward at his mothers urging she was like your story needs to be told you got fired because you tried to do the right thing  mr russell also lost his home after he lost his wells fargo job unable to find a new position in the industry he now works part time for a church in costa mesa calif helping with its outreach programs for the homeless last week he watched     in disbelief he says     as mr stumpf was grilled by the senate banking committee and insisted that wells fargo never wanted its employees to do anything unethical to meet their sales goals its a crock mr russell said they established the culture that made this happen     it comes down from the top  during the hearing mr russell said i was sitting there in a rage the people who had a conscience the employees who refused to go along they deserve vindication  workers efforts to band together to litigate cases against employers are often derailed by mandatory arbitration clauses that require them to address disputes privately and individually wells fargo has such a clause in some of its employment agreements but it was added only recently in december  according to mark folk a spokesman for the bank mr delshad the lawyer pursuing the workers cases said he thought the covered class could grow to tens of thousands of people nationwide weve had former workers and some current ones calling our office all weekend he said we have a whole bunch of new plaintiffs to be added to the suit its just unbelievable the amount and scope of this fraud  although wells fargo settled the civil cases with los angeles and its federal regulators more fallout could be coming richard cordray the director of the consumer financial protection bureau strongly hinted that the agency had referred the case on to other federal bureaus for criminal investigation and multiple federal prosecutors have sent subpoenas to wells fargo seeking information on the misconduct on thursday the house financial services committee will hold its own hearing on the scandal mr stumpf who has been invited to speak plans to appear wells fargo said',\n",

against presidentelect trump and the american people they are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over trumps authoritarian personality and followers in other words the message is here come the fascistsliberals and progressives wailed and whined about an all white male cabinet only to be made fools by trumps appointment of a black male and two women one a minority and one a trump criticthe oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt trumps inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize trump the way the paid maidan protesters were used in kiev to delegitimize the elected ukrainian governmentto the extent any of the trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs such as george soros military and financial interests and global capitalists they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence trump by offering supportat this point we dont know what a trump government is going to do if he sells out the people he wont be reelected if he is defeated by the oligarchy the people will become more radical we do not know how washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a trump presidency unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests insiders survive by going along with the current if the current changes under trump so will the insiders trump got elected because flyover america has had all it can take from the selfdealing oligarchy the vast bullk of america has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century the states hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchys stomping grounds on the ne and west coasts and in colorado and new mexico where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary if you look at the redblue electoral map geographically speaking hillarys support is very limitedwe know that hillary is an agent for the one percent the clintons  million personal wealth and  billion personal foundation are proof that the clintons are boughtandpaidfor we know that hillary is responsible for the destruction of libya and of much of syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in ukraine we know that the clinton regimes sanctions on iraq resulted in the deaths of  children these are war crimes and crimes against humanity we know hillary used government office for private gain we know she violated national security laws without being held accountable what we dont know is why groups that allegedly are liberalprogressiveleftwing are such fervent supporters of hillaryone possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motivesanother possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers but transgender homosexual and illegal alien rightsanother possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupidwhat these protesters see as a threat in trumps strong and willful personality is actually a virtue a cipher like obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged george w bush so easily stagemanaged by dick cheney nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the wellentrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives if trump were a shrinking violet the electorate would have ignored himtrump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks the poor generally teachers unions farmers abortion rights for women etc trump was elected because he said those who control the levers of power in washington and the global special interests they partner with dont have your good in mind its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities the only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is youit has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office trumps words are what americans were waiting to hearas willful as trump is he is only one person the oligarchy are manyas impressive as trumps billion dollars is the oligarchs have trillionscongress being in republican hands will spare trump partisan obstruction but congress remains in the hands of interest groups as powerful as the office of the president can be without unity in government changes from the top dont occur especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by russia and china trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers the militarysecurity complex needs an enemy for its budgetit is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the american people trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring the only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fireas for the immigration issue the obama justice sic department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that american police departments cannot discriminate against noncitizens by only hiring citizens as officers now that us citizens face arrest in their own country by noncitizens the resentment of immigrants will increase clearly it is nonsensical to devalue american citizenship in this way clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the us economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence if trump can defeat the oligarchy and save america he can go down in history as trump the great i think that this prospect appeals to trump more than more wealth instead of trying to tear him down in advance he should be supported with trumps determination and the peoples support change from the top down is possible otherwise change has to come from the bottom up and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets the post trump the great  paul craig roberts appeared first on paulcraigrobertsorg

any impact upon the selection of the person to occupy that postin colorado s republican race to win delegates to the republican national convention for selecting the republican presidential nominee there was no primary and there was no caucusas the republican magazine national review headlined on april th attempting to justify what a republican wag had just headlined as  cruz celebrates voterless win  donald trump laid a colorado goose egg because he was disorganized and amateurish their argument since they campaign for any republican but trump was he lost  because he was disorganized and amateurish  not because he had been cheated by the partyhierarchynational review explained that in the process which had been set up by the colorado republican party it s set up by each individual state s republican party not by the national republican party  delegates to the national convention would be selected at congressionaldistrict conventions and the republican s sic state convention  and this was done in order to give colorado s delegates more flexibility  not done in order to require delegates to reflect the republican or any other electorate in colorado since nr doesn t like even its own party s electoratethis was the explanation that was provided by that magazine which backs cruz and which has been campaigning ferociously against trump  their article was built upon and extensively quoted the justifications put forth by one particular cruz delegate who said the grassroots made the decision that ted cruz was the best candidate for us and the grassroots made the decision to come out for cruz and absolutely swept the table he called it  our caucus system  whatever it was it shut out all rankandfile republican voters and left everything to people like himself who could afford to do this you have to put in the work you have to put in the effort and you have to do it months ahead of time in other words only republican party activists in colorado could participate in selecting the delegates who would participate in selecting the republican nominee no one else was allowed to  their conception of the colorado republican party is that it s only the party s activists and if you re not a republican activist you have no sayit s as if to sayonly people who work in the government can have a say in how the government is to be run  it s for insiders only and of course indirectly it s for whomever pays those insiders and so enables them to  put in the work  to participatenational public radio had a different take on this matter  steve inskeep headlined there gop delegate trump primary wins  absolutely irrelevant  at convention  he interviewed curly haughland a member of the republican national committee who lives in north dakota and who said no matter what the popular belief might be   there is no connection between primaries and the actual convention well that s putting it rather bluntly haughland also said cited the gop s convention rules  and  he interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may  vote their conscience  the rules do not explicitly say this rule  is a detailed explanation of the procedure for rollcall votes however rule  does say that no delegate may be  bound  by the  unit rule meaning that delegates from a state can t all be forced to vote the same way another of haughland s points is indisputable when the convention convenes  he said  the delegates adopt their own rules which haven t been adopted yet  there is a standard template for conventions but delegates could tweak the template changing the game in any way that they want in other words the national republican committee says that all of the delegates to the republican national convention are allowed to  tweak the template changing the game in any way that they want so the delegates at that convention won t actually be representing anyone but themselves there they are entirely free to push for anyone whom they personally want to win the republican us presidential nominationthey re not bound not even on the first ballot they might pretend to be if they feel a need to put on a show that looks  democratic  but any who don t feel the need to make such a pretense can do whatever they want on the first ballot just like on any successive ballot they are free all of them are free it s only the electorate who aren t   they re not represented at allwhat about on the democratic side  wyoming had held its democratic party caucuses on april  and there really were caucuses  two days later cnn headlined wyoming democratic caucuses bernie sanders picks up another win  and reported bernie sanders won the wyoming democratic caucuses saturday providing his campaign with one more jolt of momentum before the race against hillary clinton heads east even so he made no gains in clinton s delegate lead as each earned seven delegates as a result    on april th a youtube video was posted msnbc morning host admits the  whole voting system is rigged  after bernie get s cheated here the cohosts had a conversation about the results  sanders beat hillary clinton by twelve points  to    he wins by twelve points  the accompanying image showed the delegatecount in this contest that sanders had won by  to    total  hillary clinton  bernie sanders   it wasn t  to  after allthough sanders had outscored clinton by  it was worse than evensteven for him he had actually lost by  delegates to  delegates  this system is so rigged  said one host  there s absolutely no reason any of those people voted  said the othera hillary clinton supporter was the  expert  on the panel and he said  it s not rigged these are the rules  he wasn t given time to explain that fine point   or how  the rules  were necessarily  not rigged also on april th public radio international s todd zwillich headlined falsely six reasons bernie sanders won wyoming but still tied in the delegate race  and zwillig failed to explain that word  tied  he opened  how many of you ask could bernie have won wyoming  percent to hillary s  percent but still split the delegates with her   then he repeated that there had supposedly been  the  split  but he also said  wyoming has a total of  delegates  which obviously isn tthe sum of  and he was also likewise incoherent all the way throughmaybe  the rules  in the wyoming democratic party are like that but whatever they are is so convoluted america s newsmedia couldn t explain what they were much less were they able to argue persuasively that this was somehow a democracythe only thing that s clear is that the electoral system in the united states is so convoluted so complex and so different from state to state and party to party that whatever the intent of the writers of america s constitution might have been the system as it is today can be successfully gamed and won only by interests who can afford to spend whatever billions of dollars are necessary in order to win it s certainly anything but democraticright now according to realclear politics there are only two presidential candidates who are shown repeatedly and almost consistently to be preferred by the majority of the us electorate the democrat bernie sanders is strongly preferred over the republicans trump and cruz and he is barely preferred over the republican kasich and the republican kasich is strongly preferred over the democrat clinton  clinton loses strongly to kasich and barely beats cruz while trump is the weakest generalelection candidate of allthe strongest generalelection candidates are clearly sanders in the democratic party and kasich in the republican party in a democracy those would be the candidates throughout the contest thus far neither of these two has been favored likely to win his respective party s nomination much less the presidencywhatever america is it isn t a democracy   a onepersononevote majorityrule republic in fact the only scientific study that has ever been done of the us political system finds that it s no  democracy  at all but instead an  oligarchy a nation ruled by its aristocracy its billionairesit represents them not the citizenry that might not be the theory but empirically it is the fact an oligarchy is the commonest type of dictatorship and it certainly is never a  benevolent dictatorship  even if that phrase is not an oxymoron in itselfto

her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs

fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted newsopinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the

being exposed based on thousands of podesta emails released by wikileaks in the past month or two as of last week the case became even more explosive  thomas bernpaine thomasbernpaine november   now dont get nervous because it looks like computer mumbojumbo you only need to remember two things   every picture file is actually a codepattern of numbers that our computers translate into images on the screen   some extra information has been discovered in at least one picture codepattern from a wikileaks email i reported weeks ago about this pedo ring something called photo steganography which is just the fancy term for the two points i explained just now the image jpg of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the podesta emails by wikileaks data can be hidden in a jpg file in that image a zipped directory pk was hidden inside that doesnt happen by accident the directory likely contains illegal imagery andor discussion it is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography child exploitation and child abuse some have objected that the pizzajpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data like an image a link a message etc but the point is this all the file would have to smuggle is a short password to open a secret website or zip file the hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file thats how the users would access the dirty pictures videos messages etc so from a technical angle this method is very possible and it makes sense of why the podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments are all those attachments little trojan ponies for sharing images videos passwords payment resources etc watch

images are extremely disturbing first here is a photo of tony podestas favorite work of art in his home tony podesta is a big fan of the arch of hysteria next here is an ad from ping pong pizza a

shown a disturbing interest in some sexually creepy images and expressions that are connected to the podestas and this pedo ring the problem is that rao is an assistant us attorney in the doj specifically rao is supervisor of the southern greenbelt division office for the dojs district of maryland in chevy chase maryland this means that raos district is virtually on top of the area in dc where besta pizza operates in addition besta pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels many of which could easily connect to chevy chase on top of his

he had told the department of homeland security to check people coming into our country very carefully the courts are making the job very difficult the republican president labeled robart a socalled

carried out on us soil by individuals from the seven affected countries since then for trumps order to be constitutional robart said it had to be based in fact as opposed to fiction the  attacks were carried out by hijackers from saudi arabia the united arab emirates egypt and lebanon whose nationals were not affected by the order in a series of tweets on saturday trump attacked hobarts opinion as ridiculous what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into us he asked trump told reporters at his private maralago

       " 'theyre already trying to steal  inside the gop votingrights scheme intended to derail democracy ever since africanamerican men were granted the right to vote with the passage of the th amendment in  programs were enacted to make it impossible for them to exercise the franchise and needless to say the passage of the th amendment  years later which opened the franchise to women only resulted in even more programs to deny africanamericans their ability to vote in many states all of this was quite legal under the states rights doctrine until the s when president johnson and congress finally passed the voting rights act which put the federal government in charge of monitoring the election processes of jurisdictions thatwere proven to have discriminated in the past trying to keep racial and ethnic minorities from voting is as american as apple pieover the years the right wing which has always been hostile to the idea of too much democracy worked to create an illusion that there was a great threat of voter fraud in america thatneeded to be dealt with by enacting extremely restrictive voter eligibility requirementsthere is no evidence of systematic voter fraudanywhere in america but that hasnt stopped therightfrom doing everything in itspower to make it difficult for ordinary people to exercise the right to vote if only they were as vigilant about preventing the very real threat of gun violenceand they have been helped in this task unbelievably by democrats who are so afraid of rightwing hysteria that they actually helped the republicans destroy one of their voting rights institutions acorn when a rightwing con artist produced a doctored video to tarnish its reputation they didnt even wait for the facts they immediately wrung their hands and joined the metaphorical lynching it was a low point in recent civil rights history and it proved that voting rights activists cannot count on the political class to have their backs even when it means their own party will suffervote suppression was of course the way they kept africanamericans from voting during jim crow so even as they destroyed acorn the usual suspects simultaneously worked to undermine the vra and finally succeeded in having a rightwing supreme court majority overturn it now republican state governments are much freer to restrict voting so that the undesirable minorities whom they assume will vote for the democratic party and rightly so since republicans are openly hostile to them will have a much more difficult time voting they will naturally keep up their assault on the ability of urban black voters to participate by eliminating polling places and reducing early voting which makes it difficult for hardworking people to participate but the latest attacks are coming from a number of other directions some of which are openly undemocratic and are increasingly focused on hispanicsfor instancethe argument inevenwel v abbott the latest voting case to come before the supreme court is that only eligible voters are entitled to representation by the government this means essentially that children legal residents former felons or the mentally ill have no representation obviously it will mean that undocumented workers many of whom are counted in the census will not be represented as a practical matter this will have the fortuitous result for republicans of making voting districts more rural and more white and that is the pointnobody knows how such a thing can be implemented because there is no count of eligible voters  the census doesnt ask the question and there would be no way of determining its validity anyway but the consensus among legal observers seems to be that the court will likely divide along the usual partisan lines and thus change the way representation is apportioned to favor white republicans once againthats not the only thing they are doing for obvious reasons the biggest fear among republicans these days is no longer the threat of black americans voting they will certainly continue to do everything in their power to make it hard for them to exercise their rights  they are the democrats most reliable constituency but the major threat today comes from the fastgrowing latino population indeed the campaign to deport immigrants and endbirthright citizenshipis hugely influenced by their fear that they will be demographically smothered in a few years by the american offspring of undocumented workersthe path to citizenship has them terrorizedas they see it as an obvious electoral advantage for the democratic partythere was a time when this prospect was actually considered an opportunity for republicans who believed that they could appeal to this voting bloc through their shared belief in family values and small business entrepreneurship one of george w bushs greatest assets was considered to be his ability to attract hispanics and he managed to get almost percentof the vote in  unfortunately for republicans their older white constituency wants nothing to do with this  indeed they are repelled by the idea of being in the same party as a group of immigrants who dont look and sound like them george w bush was abandoned by his party not only because of his iraq debacle but becausehe was widely considered to be soft on immigrationas you can see from the presidential campaignnotwithstanding the party leaders understanding of their electoral challenge this has hardened into a litmus test within the party republican voters want immigration stopped they want a wall they want deportation of undocumented immigrants and they want birthright citizenship to be repealed the last may require a constitutional amendment although there are some cranks who insist it can be done legislatively with this rightwing majority they may even be able to get that endorsed by the supreme court gop presidential candidates are required by the older white base to be openly hostile to latinos which ensures they will not get their votes in that case since the latino population is growing very fast and isyounger than the white population the only option aside from ethnic cleansing is to try to prevent them from voting for democrats by making it difficult at the voting booth and diluting their representation jim rutenberg is writing a series on this subjectfor the new york times magazine thatexposes the depth and breadth of this program its being roadtested in texas where there exists a serious possibility if they are unable to succeed in turning back the tide of a democratic majority in a very few years due to the rapid growth in the hispanic population they are pulling out all the stops from local reapportionment of city council seats to the abovementioned supreme court case attempting to deny representation to people who are ineligible to vote and unfortunately the republicans have one very big advantage fear they have managed to make the process so harrowing that many latinos dont feel comfortable voting even though they have a perfect right to do so and perhaps more relevantly they are discouraged and depressed about participating in the system because of the invective and hostility coming from so many white americans particularly those in power getting them to turn out to vote is a huge challenge but then thats nothing new eitherhistorian rick perlstein quoted documentationon the subject back when he was researching his book before the storm about the  goldwater campaign and the rightwing takeover of the republican party its a memo written by a johnson staffer outlining the gop vote suppression scheme called operation eagle eye this quote from the memo says it all lets get this straight the democratic party is just as much opposed to vote frauds as is the republican party we will settle for giving all legally registered voters an opportunity to make their choice onnovember rd we have enough faith in our party to be confident that the outcome will be a vote of confidence in president johnson and a mandate for the president and his running mate hubert humphrey to continue the programs of the johnsonkennedy administration but we have evidence that the republican program is not really what it purports to be it is an organized effort to prevent the foreign born to prevent negroes to prevent members of ethnic minorities from casting their votes by frightening and intimidating them at the polling place operation eagle eye was in every state in  for all the good it did them one republican lawyer very assiduously worked in arizona that year to keep hispanic voters from the polls and was reputed to have been very effective at intimidationhis name was william rehnquisthe went on to become chief justice of the supreme court his successor john roberts worked with the recount team duringthe infamous election theft of  presided over the voter fraud casethat allowed states to require id andwrote the opinion overturning the voting rights act in  these people play a very long game but its unlikely they will be able to suppress the latino vote forever their hostility may be intimidating to an older generation but the new generation is not going to accept this and there are a whole lot of young americans of hispanic descent if they vote this rightwing program will finally fail and fail spectacularly and it will likely take the whole republican agenda down with it these young americans will never identify with such a party these conservative bigots are sowing the seeds of their own demise',\n",

growing until recently however providing empirical evidence that supported these concerns proved to be very difficult almost impossible nonetheless several fairly recent empirical studies have demonstrated that in the case of the united states the policy making process is influenced to a great degree by more focused and more powerful interests compared to more diffused less powerful interests see gilens and page  winters and page  page kalla and broockman  jacobs and page  bartels and seawright  etc however due to its limited scope this paper will survey only one of these studiesby employing an imposing data set drawn from a heterogeneous set of policy initiatives  in total gilens and page demonstrated that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on us government policy while massbased interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence   pp by comparing policy preferences of american citizens at the th income percentile to that of american citizens at the th income percentile gilens and page  found that the united states  policy formulation is conditioned by the preferences of the latter group far more than it is conditioned by the preferences of the former group in fact the influence that the medium voter exerts on the us policy formulation is  near zero  gilens and page  pp  by including the data that dates all the way back to  the authors illustrated that such state of affairs has been a longterm trend making it harder for ordinary citizens to comprehend let alone reverse however  ordinary citizens might often be observed to  win  that is to get their preferred policy outcomes even if they had no independent effect whatsoever on policy making if elites with whom they often agree with actually prevail  as policy formulation is not a zerosum game gilens and page  pp  nevertheless it is crucial to point out that this correlation is erroneous in terms of causal impact and consequently provides a false sense of political equality in other words the results obtained by the authors demonstrate how the relatively high level of government s responsiveness to the preferences of average and low income citizens is nothing more than a reflection of the preferences shared by wealthy citizens however by incorporation a multivariate analysis of different test groups gilens and page  illustrated how the influence of average citizens  preferences drops rapidly once their preferences differ to that of wealthy citizensthe ideal of political equality that average american citizens as well as many scholars hold dear stands in stark contrast to the immense representational biases demonstrated by gilens and page while acknowledging that a perfect political equality has a particularly idealistic character the enormous dichotomy in the system s responsiveness to citizens at different income levels reinforces doubt associated with the presumed liberal democratic character of american society and leads this paper to conclude that the us is contrary to popular belief a liberal oligarchy as opposed to liberal democracyby embracing the iron law of oligarchy and the elite theory s perspective this paper illustrated how the us system of governance while providing constitutional that is civil liberties to its citizens espouses more focused and more powerful interests over more diffused and less powerful interests this inevitably results in the us political system being a liberal oligarchy rather than liberal democracy as it is presumed by many first the paper reviewed the iron law of oligarchy and the elite theory and highlighted some of their most prominent advocates next by briefly reflecting upon the definition of the oligarchs and the elites the paper placed the concept of corporate power and political influence it exerts in context subsequently the paper surveyed an eminent empirical study that found a vast discrepancy in the us government s responsiveness to the majority preferences as opposed to the preferences of the elites last the paper illustrated how studies confirming ostensibly desirable levels of government s responsiveness to the preferences of the average citizen neglect the reflection of those preferences to those of wealthy citizens continue this

fr die verhltnisse der russischen filmindustrie richtig teuer ist alexei misgirew das werde ich oft gefragt anfangs hat mich diese frage aus dem konzept gebracht ich wusste keine antwort weil ich selbst keinen groen unterschied gemerkt habe natrlich hatten wir bei den dreharbeiten fr the duelist keine finanziellen probleme zum beispiel mit den requisiten und kostmen wir haben dort gedreht wo wir es wollten ohne an irgendeiner ausstattung sparen zu mssen was aber den prozess selbst betrifft gab es keinen unterschied zu meinen anderen projekten ich habe meine arbeitsweise nicht gendert und mich niemandem untergeordnet das ist berhaupt das oberste prinzip von alexander rodnianski in seiner zusammenarbeit mit regisseuren  sich nicht in den kreativen prozess einzumischen und kompromisse zu finden wir standen dauernd im engen austausch ber bestimmte fragen es gab aber keinerlei vorgaben uns war beiden klar dass es im film serienproduktionen und einzelproduktionen gibt und the duelist ist eine einzelproduktion fr die individualitt und filmischer autorenstil besonders wichtig sind neben einer spannenden geschichte und einem zeitgemen visuellen konzept der regisseur alexei misgirew foto

ein millionenpublikum wenn er aber nur ein bis zwei millionen usdollar ausgeben kann wird er kaum einen bildgewaltigen und spektakulren film drehen knnen natrlich will er es es ist aber aus objektiven grnden nicht mglich so ist das interesse an der gegenwart zu erklren teilweise ist es erzwungen weil es keinen groen aufwand fr teure kulissen und computereffekte erfordertdie idee fr the duelist kam mir vor einigen jahren sie lag als schriftliche notiz von nicht mehr als zwei abstzen einfach in einer schublade und pltzlich machte es klick und ich wusste dass ich mein vorhaben jetzt realisieren

landlufig denken der zuschauer von heute assoziiert mit dem  jahrhundert geschichten aus der mottenkiste und ehrwrdige dramen aus dem provinztheater ich wollte diese stereotype aufbrechen und die zeit so zeigen wie es noch niemand vor mir getan hat  schrill brutal und mit verweisen auf die gegenwart das war natrlich unglaublich viel arbeit aber die hat mich nicht abgeschreckt vielmehr haben mich die mglichen reaktionen der zuschauer auf diesen neuen stil im rckblick auf alte zeiten beunruhigt hier werden tradierte muster radikal in frage gestellt im film von misgirew erscheint sankt petersburg als grau schwarz und schmutzig bild kinopoiskru bezogen auf sein visuelles konzept wurde the duelist schon mehrfach mit guy ritchies sherlock holmes und pitofs vidocq verglichen gefallen

motiv der ehre befragt das sich wie ein roter faden durch den film zieht sie antworten erwartungsgem ehre sei eine zeitlose idee die geschichte verweise daher zwangslufig auf die gegenwart man hat aber den eindruck dass der fatalismus der alle helden auszeichnet in ihrem film nicht weniger bedeutend ist die betonung der unausweichlichen verbindungen der figuren mit ihrem schicksal ist wohl kein zufall ja das ist ein weiteres wichtiges motiv dieses films whrend meiner intensiven beschftigung mit geschichten ber duelle bin ich auf ein sehr beeindruckendes detail gestoen im heimatland der duelle in frankreich hatten diese im  jahrhundert praktisch keine bedeutung mehr gleiches lsst sich auch von viele anderen lndern sagen der grund war die verbreitung der schusswaffe die den tdlichen ausgang des kampfes weitaus wahrscheinlicher machte als der degen und die chancen der gegner einander anglich in russland lie gerade das die kultur der duelle aufblhen ich denke das hngt mit dem

nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is   john bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for

britains role in the iraq war did not get much attention on either side of the pond upon its july release the probe was overlooked at a time that the iraq war was still raging even though everyone thought it was over and the millennials i talked to had little idea of the lies or the costs this summer and fall it became increasingly clear that the tumultuous us election cycle will not propel anyone with a peace platform to the presidency i decided i needed to do something that will be useful in the face of even more wars after the election madness is over so we launched a peoples tribunal on the iraq war as a tool to bring the antiwar movement together and build what is needed for  we aim to lay the lies and costs at the feet of president barack obama and call for a commission on truth and accountability there are years worth of testimony in reports lawsuits books and articles we have read the facts about the lies and costs over the years but the totality has never been been pulled together to show the breadth of all effected according to a report released last year by physicians for social responsibility psr physicians for global survival and international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war the us invasion and occupation killed at least one million iraqi people that would be more  million people in the united states if we compared it in terms of percentage of the population imagine the effect of  million people dying advertisement square site wide there are over  casualties on the side of the us and the coalition of the willing with a small percentage of those dead the rest are living with permanent physical and psychological wounds some so bad that us military veterans are committing suicide at a rate of  a day in  suicides surpassed war as a the leading cause of death in the us military since  us wars have cost taxpayers nearly  trillion according to a new report from brown universitys watson institute but few can understand what that number actually means nor does this amount count the cost to people in iraq or other members of the coalition of the willing i have heard these reports at various tribunals over the years but numbers and facts dont change hearts and minds this tribunal will be different it will be a peoples tribunal to be witnessed by the public which will be presented with a large body of evidence the participants on the days of the tribunal will be delivering evidence with a fiveminute statement about the meaning of that evidence dennis kucinich will present the letter he wrote to congress in october of  outlining his research which showed there was no operational connection between the saddam hussein and alqaeda or weapons of mass destruction jeremy corbyn will deliver the chilcot report elizabeth holtzman the member of congress in the s recognized as the woman who impeached nixon will deliver her book calling for the impeachment of george w bush we will be joined by people from across the

the book and testimony that emerged from their efforts inder comar will deliver the documents that make up the ongoing class action suit against six members of the george w bush administration alleging that the iraq war constituted a war of aggression there will be over  offers of testimony each day on day one december first we will focus on the lies that fed the drive to war on day two we will hear more than  people testify to innumerable costs of us war in iraq which in fact goes back at least  years  yes there is a staggering cost to us taxpayersbut also the cost to the planet and the militarization of our cities and police departments we will hear from the mother of a young black man who was killed the last week of high school by a cop who was a veteran of the iraq war suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder we will hear from soldiers who were raped by fellow soldiers rabbis and priests will discuss the cost to our morality we will hear about the costs of the us use of depleted uranium to iraqis and the children of american soldiers who served there the event will be live streamed on the real news with testimony delivered in person by live stream or by video the combination of all the testimony will be delivered to obama and congress but the real work has already begun the coalition is using the tribunal to gather local communities to discuss the cost of war to them encouraging them to review what they could have had instead of war such collective exercises demonstrate how the costs of war come home literally most of the members of our coalition are outreaching to their lists to join with a call to obama for a commission on truth and accountability other partners are outreaching for voices that still need to join those testifying when the election is finally over testifiers will begin to discuss their testimony in the media laying a path to the tribunal of details broken hearts destroyed communities and devastated families we

       " 'pamela geller on syria strike what is the objective which alqaeda satellite are we partnering with pamela geller president of the american freedom defense initiative joined siriusxm host raheem kassam on fridays breitbart news daily the conversation began with her thoughts on the previous nights airstrike against syria im deeply concerned i dont understand it geller said it seems like a   reaction it doesnt speak to a coherent policy it seems to me that trump has switched sides   listen it does seem that way kassam agreed this is what ive been saying for now the last  hours there seems to be a malign influence on him hes saying things like hey we can get you really good coverage cnn will stop writing trump on its chyron theyll start writing president trump on its chyron time magazine will put you on the front and this time it wont be scary or a joke well make you look like a leading statesman around the world all you have to do is compromise on every single thing you said during the campaign  yeah geller said with a rueful laugh i mean im laughing but im laughing with blood its not funny  i dont know when he began to care i mean that was the beauty of trump for those of us that have been in the trenches you have to become inured to this kind of withering criticism you have to develop a crocodile skin he seemed to have it he seemed to have come to the party with it it was really sort of the most fantastic thing about him she said on the one hand i always console myself with its not hillary thats always my mantra its my religion she said but this really i think is a terrible mistake back in  my organization american freedom defense initiative issued a call to president obama and to the united nations warning of an impending genocide in syria ive been acutely aware of whats going on in syria they did nothing and millions of christians and religious minorities were slaughtered i dont understand this visceral response and what is the objective who are we partnering with what   rebel gang     is it   which   satellite are we partnering with she shared kassams skepticism about the size of the truly moderate rebel force in syria and whether western intelligence services could identify real moderates and work with them effectively kassam noted isis   and the other real real enemies of the united states were celebrating the attack and asked what conclusions should be drawn from it it tells us that we dont know what were doing there geller replied i dont know what were doing there i understand the   humanitarian but im always first and foremost concerned about national interest what is the national interest of this for us look obama gave syria to russia he did he gave it to russia and so this could very well escalate into something truly unforeseen she warned i just think the united states should have taken action in a comprehensive and logical and strategic way years ago right now its just a huge catastrophe and whats he doing is he putting a finger in the dam i dont think so i dont even think its that is it just this action geller stressed that it was president barack obamas policies that led to this moment  he turned syria over to russia and so this could escalate to world war iii and for what for syria seriously she said my concern is that like president bush president trump has two factions warring with each other in the case of president bush it was    bolton the hawks as it were versus the trimmers versus the rinos like colin powell condi rice hadley burns she judged and the trimmers always win because it seems like the safe bet it seems like the   extremists are taking it a step too far  but the fact of the matter is its the trimmers that get you into trouble because you cant have a bold policy you cant go after a bold policy  geller warned  im concerned about mcmaster who is just another one who denies the motivating ideology of the terrorists she said of president trumps national security adviser he says jihad terror is not islamic this hampers our ability to respond to terrorism effectively you cant defeat an enemy that you dont understand  geller and kassam found this a contradiction of trumps campaign promise to speak forthrightly about the dangers of radical islamic terrorism he promised to deal effectively with the terrorism problem and call it islamic geller recalled this is exactly what obama and hillary refused to do mcmaster represents a defeat for the trump promise to drain the swamp its a retreat from his stated goals believe me it pains me to say this it gives me no pleasure  and mattis that terrorism defames islam     what book are they reading she added are they not reading the koran i mean listen just because you talk about it this way doesnt mean that all muslims are terrorists but we dont have to pat on the back every muslim that doesnt want to kill us  do you think jared kushner or dina powell has ever read the koran    do they understand the enemy kassam asked referring to president trumps    and deputy national security adviser for strategy respectively no i think kushners a manhattan liberal thats what i think geller replied and i think that he may be a very smart kid but thats got nothing to do with the price of eggs in china i think that he has undue influence i think thats why youre seeing these moves with the settlements in israel the     solution inviting these palestinian terrorists into this country       kassam interjected to suggest adding ivanka trumps reported meetings with planned parenthood to the list yes this is kushner i dont know how much were going to have to lose before trump gets back on track hell have to get back on track because weve suffered under these failed policies for the past really  years geller said

tmsnrtrsowlc migrant smuggling has flourished with more than  making the perilous journey across the central mediterranean in four years migrants transiting through libya often endure appalling conditions including rape torture and forced labor   the italian plan outlined in a slide presentation seen by reuters shows that italy and the european union are focusing on rebuilding libya s navy and coastguard so they can stop boats but aid groups say the libyans are poorly trained and accuse them of mishandling a rescue last month in which some  people are thought to have died  the libyans return all migrants including refugees to libya even though the situation on the ground there is far from resolved italy has been coordinating rescues off the libyan coast since    the  slides show spending of  million euros  million to expand libya s capacity by  equipping the coastguard and enabling it to establish its own rescue coordination center as well as a vast maritime searchandrescue region it also foresees a pilot project for monitoring libya s southern border the project draws on european union and italian funds and needs eu approval   the plan was presented by the italian coastguard at a conference hosted by the eu s antitrafficking mission sophia in rome last month representatives from the eu nongovernmental groups and various mediterranean navies and coastguards attended the closeddoor presentation said a source who was present libya s coastguard has already been pushing further into international waters often firing warning shots or speeding close to charity boats over the summer three charities abandoned rescue operations in part because of fears of the increasing libyan sea presence arrivals to italy have fallen by twothirds since july from the same period last year after officials working for the unbacked government in tripoli italy s partner persuaded human smugglers in the city of sabratha to stop boats leaving  the libyan coastguard also increased the rate of its interceptions turning back about  this year though it still only stops a portion of the boats  the crisis remains a major issue in italy state shelters for asylum seekers are nearly full and with elections looming politicians across the spectrum insist the flows from north africa be stopped which the new scheme is likely to address italy s coastguard did not reply to a request for comment the prime minister s office referred questions to the interior ministry which is spearheading the effort to fight people smuggling in libya and also had no comment   each nation has the right to declare its own searchandrescue zone and to carry out searchandrescue operations  a defence ministry spokesman said citing international law  ayoub qassem a libyan coastguard spokesman said he did not have details of the plan but both sides recognized the need to cooperate in tackling irregular migration    recently the italian side has been eager to cooperate with libya because it s more effective than working without libya   that s natural  he said   italy has supplied libya with four refurbished vessels so far and six more have been promised while the eu has trained about  libyan coastguards but rights groups and aid workers say partnering with libya s  unprofessional  coastguard risks exposing migrants to drowning during rescues or to further rights abuses if sent back to detention centers inside libya    from the testimony we hear from the migrants we know that people intercepted at sea have then reentered the circle of violence and imprisonment and abuse that they were fleeing  said nicola stalla searchandrescue chief for sos mediterranee one of the charities still operating off libya   activists also point to incidents such as one on nov  when crew members of the german humanitarian ship sea watch  witnessed a libyan naval vessel draw alongside an inflatable migrant boat   when people fell into the water sea watch used small rubber speedboats to pull people from the water while the libyans looked on some migrants who climbed on board the libyan vessel were whipped with ropes and the libyan boat sped off with a man still dangling in the water according to videos shot by sea watch and crew member gennaro giudetti who pulled the body of a lifeless  yearold nigerian boy named great from the water     they watched us and shot videos they even threw potatoes at us that s not how you save lives  said giudetti    libya s naval coastguard accused sea watch of obstructing the rescue and trying to lure away migrants who had already boarded their ship some migrants jumped into the water to try to reach sea watch rescuers   the libyans said their smaller speedboats which are mounted on larger patrol vessels and are the safest to use for rescues were broken    we have only one or two of these boats and they do not work so how we can put them into the water  qassem the  coastguard spokesman told reuters  the expansion of libyan patrols has led to confusion and competition over who should take the lead during rescues some charity ships say they have been directed to hold off rescues to allow the libyans to arrive putting migrants at risk   libya s searchandrescue region extends  miles from shore in some places and  miles in others qassem said   this summer the libyans notified the international maritime organization about plans to take over a large search and rescue region but withdrew the notification this month saying it would resubmit a new one soon an imo spokeswoman said   it would be the first

security council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the us mainland it has fired two missiles over japan trump speaking after a summit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe repeated his mantra the  era of strategic patience  with north korea was over and said the two countries were working to counter the  dangerous aggressions  trump also pressed japan to lower its trade deficit with the united states and buy more us military hardware  he abe will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the united states  trump said referring to the north korean missiles  the prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment as he should and we make the best military equipment by far  abe for his part said tokyo would shoot down missiles  if necessary  trump was replying to a question that was posed to abe  namely how he would respond to a quote from trump from a recent interview in which he said japan was a  samurai  nation and should have shot down the north korean missiles japan s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an  existential threat  to japan because it was aimed at a us target the us president is on the second day of a day asian trip that is focusing on north korea s nuclear missile programs and trade  most importantly we re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in north korea  trump said calling  pyongyang s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over japan  a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability   some people said that my rhetoric is very strong but look what s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last  years look where we are right now  he added north korea s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of trump s presidency the us leader who will visit south korea on the trip has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  north korea if it threatens the united states and with his dismissal of north korean leader kim jong un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission abe with whom trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls repeated at the same news conference that japan backed trump s stance that  all options  are on the table  saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on north korea and the two countries were   percent  together on the issue chinese foreign ministry spokesman hua chunying in  response to abe s comments said that the north korean  situation  was  already extremely complex sensitive and weak   we hope that under the present circumstances all sides  words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the north korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations  she said trump said he was committed to achieving  free fair and reciprocal  trade and wants to work with japan on this issue  america is also committed to improving our economic relationship with japan  trump said  as president i m committed to achieving fair free and reciprocal trading relationship we seek equal and reliable access for american exports to japan s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with japan  earlier speaking to japanese and us business executives trump praised japan for buying us military hardware but he added that  many millions of cars are sold by japan into the united states whereas virtually no cars go from the united states into japan  japan had a  billion trade surplus with the united states last year according to the us treasury department the united states was japan s second biggest trade partner after china while japan was the united states  fourth largest goods export market in  japanese officials have countered us trade complaints by noting tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the us deficit than in the past while china s imbalance is bigger in a second round of economic talks in washington last month us vice president mike pence and japanese finance minister taro aso who doubles as deputy premier failed to bridge differences on trade issues the two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks with tokyo pushing back against us calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement trump also said earlier that an indopacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the transpacific partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced washington would abandon soon after he took office the  remaining nations in the tpp to which japan s abe is firmly committed are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the united states trump met emperor akihito exchanging a handshake and nodding before his lunch and talks with abe he also met relatives of japanese citizens abducted by north korean agents decades ago to help train spies calling the kidnappings a  tremendous disgrace  and pledging to work with abe to bring the victims  back to japan where they want to be   i think it would be a tremendous signal if kim jong un would send them back  trump said  if he would send them back that would be the start of something something very special    abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career the families hope their talks with trump  the third us president they have met  will somehow contribute to a breakthrough although experts say progress is unlikely abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least  worshippers at a church in texas white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said

did not know kims exact thoughts in response tillerson said us diplomatic efforts would continue but all military options were still on the table north koreas six nuclear tests to date have all been

this is all guesswork and a lot of the motion is noise and the overlapping of extremely shortterm time horizons with longer ones be that as it may i will give it my best shot what we have seen over the last  to  hours is a massive psychological seachange  albeit almost certainly temporary  from overwhelming pessimism to overwhelming optimism regarding the prospects for the us economy and all things american that has collided with fumes from qe here and actual qe from other counties said differently a massive change in psychology has collided with free money to spark euphoria something that can generally only last a short time as that begins to take place people begin to factor in all the things that can go right and very few of the things that can go wrong though they dont handicap the amount of time it takes to accomplish said things nor the degree of difficulty in accomplishing them for instance if congress magically passed a  trillion infrastructure project it would take quite a good deal of time to get the permits and design what needs to happen before the first shovels hit the dirt so to speak not to say that the consequences of doing the project wouldnt be economically positive but there is quite a long lag between planning to do it and actually starting it that matters because at the moment the multiple on the stock market is very high north of  and it is where it is because of zeropercent rates and the ridiculous tina rationale as rates rise that tends to put pressure on valuations while it potentially causes some tinadriven buyers to think twice especially if they start to lose money given my belief that the bond bull market is finished and that a trump administration would likely be very unfriendly to bonds interest rates are headed higher something that could really be exacerbated if peoples perceptions about inflation change buy and hold on the bottom line is given the valuation of the stock market and the likely decline in bonds it will be rather difficult for the stock market to trade on the potential for good news long enough for the good news to hit therefore it is quite likely this could be the final equity market blowoff however far it may go sort of matching the bond blowoff of last summer there is some precedent for just this sort of stock market action as something similar occurred right after ronald reagan was elected i touched on this yesterday and please dont send me any emails telling me trump is not reagan i totally understand that ie that we have a potential seachange in psychology from a very negative macro outlook for the us economy to one that is expected to be better again that doesnt necessarily translate to higher equity prices due to the impact of rising rates on the current level of valuations to consider nonetheless after reagan was elected there was about a twoweek  rally in the sp which then reversed and a substantial decline ensued i believe if and when the stock market rally finally is perceived to have ended we could see a lot of destruction very fast given the brittle structure that i have talked about ad nauseam and of course a reversal in the stock market would probably impact the dollar and metals and we might even get a kneejerk reaction in bonds taking some you time nearly all markets are currently in motion so it is best to step back try to figure out what is really going on think about what you are looking for that would cause you to change any positions you have but avoid taking any action unless you are fairly certain about what is happening and why beneath the surface of the stock market one can see that tech is being sold that sector especially fang has the highest multiples and therefore is the most vulnerable to a change in the bond market plus a strong dollar hurts them while trump plays are being purchased i dont see how the market can readjust itself and really hold together because i dont think there will be enough buyers of tech to accommodate the sellers and thus the market overall could easily come under pressure fairly soon but we will just have to see how that plays out wallstreetcom basically while were in this period of quasi euphoria the market for the moment is a concept stock like biotech and concept stocks dont generally bother having fundamentals nor do people worry about them until they do and then they decline drastically as a consequence of basically being binary with all of that out of the way i will turn to the action overnight the spoos were about  higher and the market itself was higher in the early going we then got a quick reversal both lower then back higher at least for the dow the sp was up fractionally the nasdaq however kept leaking by days end the former added over  while the latter lost  away from stocks the euphoria playbook was in use and all the outside markets were very volatile with green paper quite strong while oil lost  and bonds were initially strong then were beat up again the year lost another  basis points as yields have now risen from  to  in five weeks precious metals gave up an overnight rally and were lower part of that was exacerbated by stan druckenmiller who said hed sold his gold into the electionnight rally i have covered that all in ask fleck after going negative silver climbed back into positive territory gaining  while gold lost  included below are six questions and answers from the qas with bill fleckenstein bonus qa question hi fleck  hope all is well and you are enjoying the interesting times we live in now forget trump  lets talk about the indian pm who has overnight banned large currency notes and is forcing people to deposit them in lieu of newer notes i feel that this will help to thwart black money nearly  trillion and terrorist activities fake notes etc and will also curb real estate prices but this could change how people view gold even more i suspect many indians now are conducting transactions in gold or crypto currencies such as bitcoin which could elevate gold demand import of gold in the form of coins and medallions is prohibited ah well another interesting bit of info in the ever changing times we live in narendra modi bans indias largest currency bills in bid to cut corruption enjoy answer from fleck  i suspect this will boost gold demand after the initial shakeout in a scramble for cash by real estate guys how can anyone trust the government at all after this question fleck i find it odd that slv has not broken its tuesday low  while gld has makes me believe that the down move in gld is just noise unless or until slv closes below the nov th low is this how you analyze price movement in the precious metals complex that is waiting for all assets to show a confirmation in movement thanks answer from fleck  silver is benefitting from being an industrial metal too that is part of the concept that is working right now question hey bill  in theory trump should be good for main street and i am wondering if this will cause inflation to tick higher my inclination is that it will  in the overnight gold futures market it seems to be trading strong and then loses that strength when the us opens my guess is that more spec longs are unwinding and this should bring open interest down to a more normal level i know you dont regard the cot data as too meaningful but if gold holds above  while spec long open interest declines would this be a good set up for the next leg higher thanks answer from fleck   yes plus psychology is changing  there are many scenarios that could be positive not just yours druckenmiller sells his gold question as far as i know soros does trade his positions whereas druckenmiller keeps his positions for some time what do you make of stan selling all his gold speaking to cnbc this morning fund manager stanley druckenmiller  who had been pessimistic about the us economy said that he is now quite quite optimistic on the us economy following the election of presidentelect donald trump its as hopeful as ive been in a long time i sold all my gold on the night of the election why all the reasons i owned it for the last couple of years seem to be ending namely expectations that inflation is now set to spike forcing money out of safe assets  like gold and treasurys  and into the dollar answer from fleck  druck is a trader and investor please see the other post on this topic question in india the gold prices have doubled in few cities due to the currency note issue wall street and the moron drunkenmiller does not have a clue chinese demand will also accelerate due to yuan fall gold demand is spiking up in asia all over out of touch wall street can control the gold prices only for few days if this continues i will load up gold bars here in america to sell in india and rest of the asia there are enough rich people in india who want gold maybe stan should sell any coins left over to me answer from fleck  you make worthwhile points about demand but in the short run they can be trumped by the herd for a little while question interestingi dont recall gold miners caring a hoot when druckenmiller declared that he was long gold now that he says hes out of gold they obediently pay attention answer from fleck  lol for this five minutes  to subscribe to bill fleckensteins fascinating daily thoughts click here kwn

       " 'the antitrump protesters are tools of the oligarchy leave a reply reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order arthur m schlesinger jr the crisis of the old order paul craig roberts  who are the antitrump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progresives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election they look like and are acting worse than the white trash that they are denouncing i think i know who they are they are thugs for hire and are paid by the oligarchy to delegitimize trumps presidency in the way that washington and the german marshall fund paid students in kiev to protest the democratically elected ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup the organization changeorg which claims to be a progressive group but might be a front along with other progressive groups for the oligarchy is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the electoral collage to annul the election by casting their votes for hillary remember how upset progressives were when trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged now progressives are doing what they damned trump for saying he might do under certain conditions the western presstitutes used the protests in kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup the protest pay was good enough that nonukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money at the time i posted the amounts paid daily to protesters reports came in to me from eastern and western europe from people who were not ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were ukrainians the same thing is going on with the trump protests cnn reports that for many americans across the country donald trumps victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept tens of thousands filled the streets in at least  us cities overnight this is the exact reporting that the oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got i hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in  cities were a spontaneous event how did  independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election what is the point of the protests and what interest is served by them as the romans always asked who benefits there is only one answer the oligarchy and only the oligarchy benefits trump is a threat to the oligarchy because he intends to stop the giveaway of american jobs to foreigners the jobs giveaway sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as free trade is one of the main reasons for the st century worsening of the us income distribution money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to american manufacturing employees and college graduates has been rerouted to the pockets of the one percent when us corporations move their production of goods and services sold to americans offshore to asian countries such as china and india their wage bill falls the money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders the ladders of upward mobility that had made america the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multibillionaires trump is a threat to the oligarchy because he intends peaceful relations with russia in order to replace the profitable soviet threat the oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the russian threat by demonizing russia accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable cold war the militarysecurity complex was angry when president reagan brought the cold war to an end before these leaches on american taxpayers could get the cold war going again the soviet union collapsed as a result of a rightwing coup against soviet president mikhail gorbachev the militarysecurity complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up the war on terror to keep the money flowing to the one percent but as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of the muslim threat even insouciant americans knew that the muslims did not have thousands of icbms carrying powerful thermonuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the united states in a few minutes neither did the muslims have the red army capable of overrunning all of europe in a couple of days indeed the muslims havent needed an army refugees from washingtons wars enabled by europeans are overrunning europe the excuse for the annual trillion dollar  billion  militarysecurity budget was missing so the oligarchy created the new hitler in russia hillary was the oligarchys principle agent for heating up the new coldl war hillary is the tool enriched by the oligarchy whose job as president was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the militarysecurity complex with hillary in the white house the looting of the american taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the one percent could go forward unimpeaded but if trump resolves the russian threat the oligarchy takes an income hit hillarys job as president was also to privatize social security in order that her wall street benefactors can rip off americans the way that americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under obamacare those americans who do not pay attention think mistakenly that the fbi cleared hillary of violating national security protocals with her email practices the fbi said that hillary did violate national security but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance she got off from indictment because the fbi concluded that she did not intentionally violate national security protocals the investigation of the clinton foundation continues in other words in order to protect hillary the fbi fell back on the ancient common law rule that there can be no crime without intent see pcr and lawrence stratton the tyranny of good intentions  one would think that protesters if they were legitimate would be celebrating trumps victory he unlike hillary promises to reduce tensions with powerful russia and we hope also with china unlike hillary trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of  cities against him in other words the protests against the american people for electing trump as their president are pointless the protests are happening for one reason only the oligarchy intends to delegitimize the trump presidency once president trump is delegitimized it will be easier for the oligarchy to assassinate him unless the oligarchy can appoint and control trumps government trump is a prime candidate for assassination the protests against trump are suspicious for another reason unlike hillary obama and george w bush donald trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries sending millions of refugees from the oligarchys wars to overrun europe trump earned his fortune and if by hook or crook not by selling us government influence to foreign agents as bill and hillary did so what are the protesters protesting there is no answer except that they are hired to protest just as the maidan protesters in kiev were hired to protest by us and german financed ngos the protests in kiev were equally pointless because presidential elections were only months away if ukranians really believed that their president was conspiring with russia to keep ukraine from becomming a western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand the only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup the us did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new ukrainian government as victoria nuland and the us ambassador in kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the inernet the maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible the protests were without any doubt arranged by washington through assistant secretary of state victoria nuland a neoconservative brought into the state department by hillary clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with russia trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the oligarchy that he is thought to be trump won the presidency but the oligarchy is still in power which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between president trump and the oligarchs karl marx learned from historical experience and lenin stalin and pol pott learned from karl marx that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them we have proof of this thoughout south america every revolution by the indigenious people has left unmolested the spanish ruling class and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and washington washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of honduras on a number of occasions recently washington helped elites evict the female presidents of argentina and brazil the presidents of venezuela ecuador and bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive washington is determined to get its hands on julian assange to achieve this washington intends to overthrow the ecuadoran governmenrt that in defiance of washington gave julian assange political asylum hugo chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the spanish ruling class in venezuela when the ruling class participated in a cia coup against chavez but before the cia could kill chavez the people and the military forced his release instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him chavez let them go according to marx lenin and stalin this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary to rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution latin american has proved itself unable to learn this lesson revolutions cannot be concillatory trump is a dealmaker the oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change trump is not perfect he might fail on his own but we should back him on the two most important elements in his program to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers and to halt washingtons policy of permitting globalism to destroy americans economic prospects if tensions between nuclear powers worsen we wont be here to worry about other problems the combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare that trump understands this is reason to support him note some believe that trump is a ruse conducted by the oligarchy however as hillary is the boughtandpaidfor representative of the oligarchy such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary it is preferable for the oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around another sellout increases the anger of the people if hillary had won the oligarchy would have had the voters mandate for their platform sf

       " ' takeaways from the first presidential debate there were a couple of notsoverysubtle signals here inside of hofstra university that donald trump lost monday nights highlyanticipated debate against hillary clinton and badlythe first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters picked up by my attentive colleague steve shepard inside the debate hall as trump meandered selfdefensively through a succession of answers against a very focused very energized and very wellrehearsed hillary clintonanother tell after the minute sparring match finished clintons team practically bounded into the spin room  more in glassyeyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected the gop nominees people by contrast dribbled into the media pen like surly seventhgraders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation fk lets do this a prominent trump surrogate said before diving into a scrumtrump and his newish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the oval office but this bestlaid plan unraveled on monday  amid clintons steely assault and the dignified interrogation of nbcs lester holt who struck a deft balance between facilitator bs detector and lion tamerwithin minutes of the opening bell clintons attacks forced domesticated donald to go feral  he bellowed interrupted her repeatedly grunted and toward the bedraggled end became muted and poutyit was bizarre said barack obamas campaign manager david plouffe who like many clinton allies seemed visibly relieved he was clearly rattled and clearly focused on defending himself which im told narcissists are prone to do and he clearly faded at the end its not like shes going to jump out to a point lead but this was goodwhether or not this reverses trumps momentum or reestablishes clintons control of the race is an open question who won is not here are five takeawaystrump was wimpy when defensive he is supposed to be the big meanie but it was clinton who hit him where it hurt most it doesnt take a jung or even dr phil after a couple of bud lights to figure out that the gop nominee  who boasts like a barfly  just might be overcompensating hence clinton who started the debate a little tentatively quickly launched into a carefully planned program of freudian mindgames contrasting her own middleclass businessman dad who had his own issues with trumps imperious largerthanlife father fred who launched his sons business career but also was said to be extremely tough on himfirst she started in with a paean to her fathers running a small printing business in chicago this might be the first time a candidate has described in detail the silkscreen squeegee process on a debate stage  then she pivoted to mocking supposedly selfmade trumps start in the real estate business you know donald was very fortunate in his life and thats all to his benefit he started his business with  million borrowed from his father she said icilymy father gave me a very small loan in  and i built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars he responded weakly  and so it went on a range of topicswhether it was because clinton was so well prepped and trump was so breezily unprepared  or had a simple case of opening night jitters  the bullyboy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat answering an attack with a harsher one she went right for trumps ego  questioning his questionable  billion net worth his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting isisin  preparing for a primary race shed eventually lose clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacks werent about exploiting someones weaknesses but challenging an opponents perceived strengths when confronted with that assault trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his republicans wincing it was a draw former massachusetts sen scott brown said but he was on the defensive far too much thats a direct result of his inexperiencewhat about the clinton foundation the former secretarys debate team including longtime aide phillippe reines who snapped a predebate photo in a trump circledfinger pose expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her familys foundation they were worried about it while he hammered her eversobriefly on emails he was so engaged in selfjustification he flatout forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousyhis  years attack worked  and hell use it again trump may have lost the first debate but hes proven to be a fast learner and is likely to come back stronger in early october for the second debate a town hall style affair in st louis and there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of hofstra  the most valuable an assault demonstrable and factcheckerfriendly on clintons effectiveness in plus years of public lifethe beentherenotdonethat argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on bill clintons passage of the increasingly unpopular nafta agreement from the s and hillary clintons electionyear flipflop from tpp booster to opponentwhen she started talking about this it was really very recently trump said of her opposition to the trade deal shes been doing this for  years and why hasnt she made the agreements better the nafta agreement is defective just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the factwhen clinton claimed that she planned to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs he scoffed and shot back but you havent done it in  years or  yearsclinton effectively attacked his business career trumps attempt to head off debatenight questions about his fiveyear campaign promoting the birther slander against barack obama was a humbling faceplant his attempt to pin the origin of the charge against clinton associate sid blumenthal was semieffective with the political press but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an africanamerican moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation trump offered neither  and suggested obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard because its now been resoundingly put to restpolitically his tortured explanation helps energize black voters  who already oppose him in historic numbers but later in the debate clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among everelusive white workingclass voters and independents trumps failure to turn over his tax returns clinton went there with a vengeance  engaging in a little trumpesque factfree speculation about the motives of the billionaire developerturnedreality tv starso youve got to ask yourself why wont he release his tax returns clinton mused with relish and i think there may be a couple of reasons first maybe hes not as rich as he says he is second maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be third we dont know all of his business dealings or maybe he doesnt want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didnt pay any federal income taxtrumps answer did more harm than goodthat makes me smart he said  referring to his business not his political acumenher most effective attack  and his worst answer if the gop nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate he got it when clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years again clinton brought it back to her father describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his billive met dishwashers painters architects marble installers drapery installers who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do clinton said delivering a carefully scripted attack we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses its a beautiful facility it immediately was put to use and you wouldnt pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to dothis is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class  and his flippant response yet again gave comfort to his enemiesmaybe he didnt do a good job and i was unsatisfied

about the evolution of human consciousness that many adult readers find impenetrable with their bright illustrations and breezy language     sal is ready for an adventure pretty much typifies the tone

prejudice j d salingers the catcher in the rye and harper lees to kill a mockingbird minus the rape charges ku klux klan rallies and racial slurs the goal of all of this is to get them really psyched

on these   stories by sanitizing them and losing the themes  some educators are skeptical of efforts to   complex literary works to small children especially when theres such a rich body of classic childrens literature its ludicrous to take great works that are clearly for adults and reduce them for children said monica edinger a   teacher at the dalton school in manhattan who dismissed kinderguides as a disingenuous attempt to exploit parents insecurities still some parents counter that children can absorb the bigger themes like the idea of resilience in the old man and the sea or adventurousness in on the road  brent almond a graphic designer and parenting blogger who lives in maryland said his    son jon had responded enthusiastically to some of the books a lot of these books are melancholy or outright depressing but its been cool to see how he reacts to them mr almond said jon likes the book based on  the best because its in space and its kind of creepy mr almond said jon didnt seem especially bothered by one of the more chilling scenes when the ships computer hal turns on the astronauts and sends one of them out of the spaceship to his death mr almond said  ms medina and mr colting got the idea for kinderguides about a year ago when they were visiting her family in kansas mr colting was reading the old man and the sea and ms medinas    niece asked him what it was about he realized the story was easy to summarize and saw a market opportunity mr colting a native of sweden already had a background in publishing albeit a somewhat checkered one in  he was sued by the salinger estate for publishing an unauthorized sequel to the catcher in the rye  he settled the lawsuit and withdrew copies from north america despite that earlier legal entanglement mr colting had no qualms about repurposing famous novels as picture books including the catcher in the rye  he argues that because they function as study guides as well as entertainment the kinderguides books dont infringe on copyrighted works some copyright experts dispute that logic if you are literally taking a book and trying to translate it for children taking what makes it literature and copying that that sounds like infringement said rebecca tushnet a professor at the georgetown university law center this year mr colting and ms medina started an independent publishing company out of their home in

       " 'bombing case points to gaps in trumps and clintons antiterrorism plans  the new york times washington     there is nothing in donald j trumps or hillary clintons antiterrorism plans that would have had much chance of stopping the bombings in new york and new jersey that ahmad khan rahami is accused of carrying out the subject of how to prevent terrorism will almost certainly be a major topic on monday night when the two presidential candidates face off in their first debate but the truth is that cases like mr rahamis fit neatly into no categories and his journey from childhood immigrant to naturalized citizen to accused terrorist shows that the debate now underway on the campaign trail is too simplistic it fails to address the hardest and most common cause of radicalization in the united states when personal demons morph into ideologically driven violence mr rahami came to the united states from afghanistan as a    and later became a citizen mr trumps insistence in recent days that he has no problem with ethnic profiling might have led to tougher interrogations of mr rahami when he traveled to quetta pakistan the center of taliban power and returned or when he came back from there with a pakistani wife the strongest indication of his leanings came in  when the local police and the f b i investigated mr rahamis fathers claim that his son was a terrorist but finding no evidence the authorities did not act since mr rahami is an american citizen the only way he could have been locked up without being charged was with a detention system similar to the way   were placed in japanese internment camps during world war ii that was a technique mr trump told time magazine in december that he might or might not have supported at the time he added that as undesirable as it would be to revive such an arrangement in an age of terrorism war is tough  mrs clintons approach would be to rely on countermessaging to prevent radicalization and to try to recognize early signs of extremism but no one seems quite certain how mr rahami was radicalized     on the internet during trips to pakistan or perhaps by his new wife and mrs clintons approach even its advocates acknowledge is no guarantee     it tries to stem the tide rather than reverse it mr trump in short has described a policy of keeping potential terrorists out of the country altogether even if that means suspending or violating americas longstanding principles of taking in refugees and not discriminating against immigrants on the basis of their religion mrs clinton in contrast has argued for the vetting of immigrants     about their history or sympathy for radical ideology     but working to counter extremists messages or behavior a core element of mrs clintons counterterrorism strategy has been to build on pilot programs in four communities that among other features offer residents ways to report individuals who could become radicalized or otherwise exhibit troubling behavior the four communities are   paul los angeles boston and montgomery county md in the elizabeth n j neighborhood where mr rahami lived and worked such a program might     or might not     have made a difference in recent years for instance some friends of mr rahamis noticed a significant change in his personality and religious devotion after a trip to afghanistan where he and his relatives are from but there is no evidence that they alerted anyone or expressed any concern mrs clinton aims to set up an   system community by community that builds on a growing number of programs that the obama administration terms countering violent extremism  the aim is not just to rely on religious leaders such as imams to help detect the early signs of radicalization but also to enlist teachers coaches physicians and others who might notice subtle changes in an individuals behavior and perhaps with family and friends intervene mrs clinton also suggested in december that she would accelerate work with technology companies to take radical speech off facebook youtube snapchat and encrypted apps used by terrorists you are going to hear all the familiar complaints freedom of speech she told the brookings institution she suggested those complaints should be dismissed her advisers acknowledge this would not constitute a complete solution     but neither would immigration bans which they view as counter to american values look were never going to be able to identify every potential bad actor solely through a police record or their involvement with other bad actors said daniel benjamin a former state department terrorism coordinator and now a scholar at dartmouth college so having more eyes on this and more awareness within communities is absolutely essential and will have to be a key part of the solution  mr benjamin who is an adviser to the clinton campaign acknowledged tuesday that theres no guarantee that such programs would have identified rahami ahead of time  but he said mr rahamis case and that of a   man who stabbed  people at a mall in st cloud minn before he was shot and killed by an   police officer appear to be examples of fairly dramatic changes in behavior that might have set off alarms  mrs clinton spoke by phone for  minutes on tuesday morning with a group of top national security and counterterrorism advisers about lessons learned from the most recent terrorist attacks and what additional steps a clinton administration would need to take to prevent strikes on american soil according to a summary of the call that the campaign released they also discussed how to ensure that the police and other law enforcement agencies followed up on individuals who had been previously identified as possible threats mrs clinton has called for an intelligence surge to improve information sharing among federal agencies and with foreign partners mrs clinton and her advisers mulled over ways to combat     attacks and online radicalization     without specific direction or enabling from groups like the islamic state or al qaeda     and how we can best balance the right to privacy with this modern national security imperative according to the summary finally the group examined the dangers of inflammatory rhetoric generalizations and expressions of prejudice all of which mrs clinton and her supporters have accused mr trump of using in his social media comments and campaign speeches mr trump has one word for those solutions weak  he argued during the primaries that he would temporarily ban all muslim immigration a position that received withering criticism from his own party he also said he would take out the families of terrorists a violation of international conventions he combined that with what he maintains would be a far more relentless attack on the islamic state including seizing oil in areas where it operates presumably in iraq although most of the oil belongs to iraq and the bush administration always went to some lengths to say it would be preserved for the benefit of the iraqi people not sold by the united states under pressure mr trump amended his approach to saying he would temporarily ban immigration from countries that have been breeding grounds for terrorism he seemed to have afghanistan and pakistan in mind but that definition could easily embrace germany france belgium and britain as well had that program been in effect in  it might have stopped mr rahamis entry into the country as a    or his readmission in  when he and his family were admitted as refugees mr trump said in a rally on tuesday that the lesson of the new york and new jersey bombing attacks was the need for an immigration crackdown these attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country he said attack after attack     from   to san bernardino to orlando     we have seen how failure to screen who is entering the united states puts all of our citizens in great danger  he said mrs clinton was for people pouring in from syria though the   refugees who have come from there this year is a tiny fraction of what european nations have taken in mr trump called for stopping the massive inflow of refugees which hillary clinton is trying to drastically increase ',\n",

missile s maximum altitude and flight time are correct it would have a theoretical range of at least  kilometers about  miles that means it could have reached los angeles denver or chicago depending on variables such as the size and weight of the warhead that would be carried atop such a missile in an actual attacknorth korean leader kim jong un said saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrated his country can hit the us mainland hours after the launch left analysts concluding that a wide swath of the united states including los angeles and chicago is now in range of north korean weaponsthe korean central news agency said that kim expressed  great satisfaction  after the hwasong missile reached a maximum height of  kilometers  miles and traveled  kilometers  miles before accurately landing in waters off japan the agency said that the test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of the missile it says was capable of delivering a  largesized heavy nuclear warhead analysts had estimated that the north s first icbm on july  could have reached alaska and said that the latest missile appeared to extend that range significantlyimmediately after the launch us and south korean forces conducted livefire exercises south korean defense minister song youngmoo called for the deployment of strategic us military assets   which usually means stealth bombers and aircraft carriers   as well as additional launchers of an advanced us antimissile systemjapanese government spokesman yoshihide suga said the missile launched late friday night flew for about  minutes   about five minutes longer than the first the missile was launched on very high trajectory which limited the distance it traveled and landed west of japan s island of hokkaidothe kcna quoted kim as saying that the launch reaffirmed the reliability of the country s icbm system and an ability to fire at  random regions and locations at random times  with the  entire  us mainland now within range the agency said that the test confirmed important features of the missile system such as the proper separation of the warhead and controlling its

may well have been a huge mistake on the part of everyone involved when the us returned in  it was saudi cash that financed the sunni wahhabist was against the coalition government in baghdad a war that continues to this day with the same cast of characters the same saudi cash but they now call it isis  americans died fighting saudi paid jihadists saudi arabia has always known that iraq has only allowed them to continue their mischief so long as they served a purpose when the war with iran ended in  that purpose had ended also saudi mischief in iraq playing tribe against tribe pushing for kurdish separatism and partnering with israeli intelligence ramped up as america scaled back her military presence under president obama by  a logistics and command structure to destroy both syria and iraq had been established headquartered in the saudi embassies in beirut and amman and operating military operations centers designed and built by the israelis at key locations in turkey and quickly bolstered by satellite facilities across iraq and syria the saudis were feeling time getting away from them their decades of military buildup based on endless oil and investment performance no long sustainable they had to knock out syria and iraq using israel turkey and nato as surrogates push the us into destroying iran and cleanse yemen of threats they bribed everyone they got near were the saudis really the ones behind the arab spring do we see the hands of saudi arabia when israel channels hamas fighters into the yarmouk camp outside damascus to bolster isis forces these are the

terror threats why is no one looking at where it comes from who finances whose ideas are behind it and who it serves with fingers pointing at the mossad or cia and so many others the real issue is wahhabism and the real root of it all is saudi arabia there is no version of  that doesnt credit saudi mohammed atta as planner of  whether assisted by israeli art students or osama bin laden

by powerful iraniantrained militias the americantrained army joined isis had prime minister maliki back in  been more aware of the threat he would have moved against the army that however would have renewed the civil war a war that could only have been ended with iranian military intervention and iran was still reeling with sanctions and the threat of american invasion that threat is gone also that world is gone or soon will be as is being played out in mosul and aleppo no one would have imagined baghdads resolve or the partnership between russia and iran still in question is turkeys role it is clear someone promised them aleppo and mosul as is reflected in their military incursions into syria and iraq if saudi arabia thinks turkey will lift a hand to block iraqs wrath they are delusional turkey knows it can have peace with iran and that both share similar ideas about the kurds this far outweighs any turkish ambitions to the south turkey may well be planning a new ottoman empire but saudi arabia is not in the cards for turkish occupation members of the abbas combat squad a shia militia trained with iraqi soldiers in basra this leaves the protection of the united states and the upcoming election is there any american political leader that would oppose iraq were they to hit saudi arabia by  or  the prediction is that iraq will come out of this war intact and if they do with a victorious army for the first time genuinely answerable to baghdad and reeling from the battle of mosul likely to leave  civilians dead in its wake or more the national enmity for saudi arabia will know no bounds the sunni gangsters from anbar that aligned with the saudis are mostly dead many beheaded by isis the promised kurdish state in erbil the socalled barzani sultanate will not be handed control of the massive kirkuk oil fields and the ceyhan pipeline by isis as may well have been planned without these assets erbil will still enjoy a strong commercial presence but will never be able to reach into the kurdish diaspora and bring the millions home and under questionable rule subject to erbils deal making with everyone eventually erbil will become a ghost town the sons that returned will again migrate and turkish ambitions seemingly undone will be fulfilled as it appears now iraq will survive iraq also knows that what saudi arabia tried twice they will try again and that

election due in  labour winning in glasgow a city of one million people that backed secession from britain in a referendum in  would make the arrival of prime minister corbyn more likely and  reduce the chances of scottish independence by damaging the snp labour policies such as renationalization of the railways and more funding for public services appeal to scots on the left though they may scare off more conservative voters with higher taxes and controls over the free market  scottish labour announces a new leader on saturday after a contest between trade unionist richard leonard whom

austerity is definitely what is hurting us  she told reuters saying it was  disgusting  that struggling families on welfare were being penalized of a dozen people interviewed by reuters in east glasgow   said they would vote for labour or consider it seriously east glasgow and seven other seats in the glasgow area are among  scottish constituencies held by the snp that would need a swing of less than  percent for a labour win according to pollster survation at present labour has  scottish seats with just a handful more votes in each marginal area scotland could make the difference between a minority and a majority labour government in britain s seat house of commons as most of scotland s budget is controlled by the government in london young believes only corbyn can bring real change scots like young now seem to blame the snp in power in the devolved scottish parliament for a decade rather than the uk government in london for not sending enough money to scotland  glasgow an industrial center on britain s northwestern coast was a hub of leftwing radicalism and a lynchpin of labour s political success nationwide for nearly a century under tony blair and gordon brown the party took a centrist direction and labour started to fall out of favor in the north labour was spurned by scottish voters when it campaigned with the rival conservatives to defend the yearold union of england and scotland in the  referendum scots rejected independence but in a british election eight months later labour lost all but one of its  seats in scotland  a lot of people who voted  yes  during the referendum did so because they wanted a sense of change  said kate watson the labour candidate in glasgow east  jeremy s given us permission to be heard again   corbyn avoids mention of blair and brown and namechecks labour s first leader keir hardie as a mentor appealing to old party values which play well here rebecca hynam  is a primary school teacher who says politicians would be  shocked  by shortages of staff and materials in schools she backs corbyn  in maths we don t have enough calculators for my class   glaswegians interviewed seemed to overlook the weaknesses of scottish labour its flipflops on the independence question and its wobbles on what it wants from brexit nevertheless many trust corbyn whose personal style reminds some people of a kindly

terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculummore stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averres the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the westchapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldunin chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the timesimilar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapterin chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topicoften when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholarschapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting argumentschapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequencechapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensivechapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformationanyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggressionthis book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace',\n",

sports organizations to discipline other russian teams after revelations of a   doping scheme the international association of athletics federations track and fields global governing body had barred russias team from competing at the summer games in rio de janeiro next month because of an elaborate cheating plot which investigators confirmed this week with forensic evidence and computer records the court of arbitration for sport the final arbiter on global sports disputes to which russia had appealed said that the penalty was legally sound with just over two weeks until the opening ceremony in rio the international olympic committee had deferred the decision of whether to take aggressive measures to individual sports federations like the i a a f after detailed proof of   cheating was produced this week in a report by the world   agency olympic officials said they would explore legal options but they also indicated that they would await the arbitration courts decision before taking action thursdays ruling affirming the track and field organizations authority over a nations olympic participation enables the i o c to pass responsibility for the russian doping crisis to the  individual sports federations that participate in the summer games olympic officials are set to convene on the matter sunday among the options ahead olympic officials could call on the other individual sports federations     such as those in gymnastics and weight lifting     to follow the i a a fs lead and engage in a    review of russian athletes registered to compete in rio or a blanket ban of the russian federation could be adopted in response to thursdays decision sebastian coe head of the track and field organization said that while he was thankful the ban had been upheld he was not celebrating i didnt come into this sport to stop athletes from competing he said in a statement the appeals court said that because of the urgent nature of the case it was issuing only its verdict which was unanimous its full decision including the grounds for the verdict will be issued as soon as possible the court said in my view certainly this decision absolutely violates the rights of clean athletes honest athletes and sets a collective responsibility precedent vitaly mutko russias sports minister said at a news conference in moscow in instituting its ban the i a a f invited russian athletes living outside the country who had been regularly tested for drugs to petition to compete individually officials said they had offered that option in part to protect against court challenges so far two russian track and field athletes have been cleared to compete in rio darya klishina a long jumper and yuliya stepanova a   runner both of whom live in the united states the i a a f said that the exempted athletes would not compete in rio under the russian flag but rather as unaffiliated athletes russia won  medals in track and field including eight golds at the  summer olympics in london whether the countrys medal aspirations in other sports in rio are squashed too could soon be determined by other sports federations those federations however have little expertise in adjudicating doping cases and in the political world of sports some have strong ties to russia last week the president of the international swimming federation julio c maglione of uruguay traveled to moscow to meet with mr mutko four days later as antidoping officials indicated that they were preparing to request that the i o c ban russias entire olympic team the swimming federation released a statement saying it was concerned by the premature calls to keep russia out of the games sports officials and antidoping authorities alike have agitated for strong action from the i o c in recent days pointing out that the olympic organization had in its power a drastic option that would seem to be beyond legal challenge banning the whole russian delegation from the games its really important for the i o c to defend its integrity and make a strong statement now by suspending the russian national olympic committee said max cobb president of the united states biathlon association mr cobb added

investigators as a main coordinator of the scheme is also an executive board member of the russian olympic organization on monday president vladimir v putin of russia said he had provisionally suspended mr nagornykh and other implicated officials for the i o c to wait until the arbitration decision was announced on thursday mr cobb said was unnecessary stalling  more than a dozen national

in the olympics according to the correspondence which was obtained by the new york times this is a responsibility that cannot and should not be delegated by the i o c  the letter said anything less than a full ban the officials wrote is not a reasonable and proportionate measure to protect the value of the olympic promise given the circumstances caused by the   doping program that corrupted the

aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the obama presidency mr pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet he stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals he withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market in total as the chairman of the f c c mr pai released about a dozen actions in the last week many buried in the agencys website and not publicly announced stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts they said mr pais message was clear the f c c an independent agency will mirror the trump administrations rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the obama administration with these   tactics chairman pai is showing his true stripes said matt wood the policy director at the consumer group free press the public wants an f c c that helps people he added instead it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for  mr pai a former lawyer for verizon was elevated by mr trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority republican member for the past three years known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the f c c s authority mr pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean he noted that his predecessor tom wheeler had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election many of those efforts mr pai argued went beyond the agencys legal authority these   actions which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken should not bind us going forward mr pai said in a statement released friday accordingly they are being revoked  the efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media telecommunications and the internet the biggest target will be net neutrality a rule created in  that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic the rule which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility was the tech centerpiece of the obama administration on friday the f c c took its first steps to pull back those rules analysts said mr pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   att and verizon   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download if a provider like att offers free streaming of its directv programs does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage under its previous leadership the f c c said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned but mr pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers particularly   households the speed of the ruling and the chairmans tone are very encouraging for internet service providers said paul gallant an analyst at cowen i think its a down payment on net neutrality with much more to follow  last week mr pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility the reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules mr pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules but he faces legal hurdles a federal court upheld the rules last year and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules mr pai will have the help of powerful members of congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service and he is popular among republican leaders including the senates majority leader mitch mcconnell who with other members viewed mr pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the obama years mr pai  the child of immigrants from india who settled in kansas is a fresh face for the republican party congress could introduce legislation that limits the agencys ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers the agency has strayed from its core mission said marsha blackburn a republican representative from tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee she has called for a hearing within two weeks on the f c c agenda under the new administration democrats in congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules they said mr pai described as a   student of telecom law would be a tough adversary and they face great opposition from republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules the key here is that its already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this said representative anna g eshoo democrat of california ajit pai is intelligent and genial but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest  most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around mr pais early actions that included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers none of the providers currently serve   consumers but mr pais comments could foreshadow a   of the lifeline   subsidy program on monday the f c c is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison but it told a judge a few days ago that mr pai disagreed with many aspects of the case mignon clyburn

repeated the israelineocon tripe about iran destabilizing the middle east when shiiteruled iran actually has helped stabilize iraq and syria against sunni terrorist groups and other militants supported by saudi arabia and   to a degree   israel he again denounced the iranian nuclear agreement whose main flaw in the eyes of the israelis and the neocons is that it disrupted their plans to bombbombbomb iran and he called for  regime change  in iran a long beloved dream of the israelis and the neocons he repeated the israelineocon propaganda about hezbollah as a terrorist organization when hezbollah s real crime was driving the israeli military out of southern lebanon in  ending an israeli occupation that began with israel s  invasion he praised his rushtojudgment decision to bomb syria last april in line with israelineocon propaganda against president bashar alassad and partly out of a desire to please the same washington establishment that is still scheming how to impeach him he spoke with the crass hypocrisy that the neocons and many israeli leaders have perfected particularly his demand that  all nations   respect   the rights of every other sovereign nation    when he made clear that he like his white house predecessors is ready to violate the sovereignty of other nations that get in official washington s waya litany of warsjust this century the united states has invaded multiple nations without un authorization based on various  coalitions of the willing  and other subterfuges for wars of aggression which the nuremberg tribunals deemed the  supreme international crime  and which the un was specifically created to preventnot only did president george w bush invade both afghanistan and iraq   while also sponsoring  antiterror  operations in many other countries   but president barack obama acknowledged ordering military attacks in seven countries including against the will of sovereign states such as libya and syria obama also supported a violent coup against the elected government of ukrainefor his part trump already has shown disdain for international law by authorizing military strikes inside yemen and syria in other words if not for the fear of provoking american anger many of the world s diplomats might have responded with a barrage of catcalls toward trump for his blatant hypocrisy without doubt the united states is the preeminent violator of sovereignty and international law in the world today yet trump wagged his finger at others including russia over ukraine and china over the south china seahe declared  we must reject threats to sovereignty from the ukraine to the south china sea we must uphold respect for law respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow then with a seeming blindness to how much of the world sees the united states as a law onto itself trump added  the scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the united nations is based of course in the us mainstream media s commentary that followed trump s hypocrisy went undetected that s because across the american politicalmedia establishment the us right to act violently around the world is simply accepted as the way things are supposed to be international law is for the other guy not for the  indispensible nation  not for the  sole remaining superpower on bibi s leashdespite some of his  america first  rhetoric   tossed in as red meat to his  base    trump revealed a global outlook that differed from the bushobama neoconservativeliberalinterventionist approach in words only in substance trump appears to be just the latest american poodle on bibi netanyahu s leashfor instance trump bragged about attacking syria over a dubious chemicalweapons claim while ignoring the role of the saudiisraeli tandem in assisting al qaeda and its syrian affiliate trump threatened the international nuclear agreement with iran while calling for regime change in tehran two of netanyahu s top priorities and trump warned that he would  totally destroy north korea  over its nuclear and missile programs while making no mention of israel s rogue nuclear arsenal and sophisticated delivery capabilitiesignoring saudi arabia s ties to terrorism trump touted his ludicrous summit in riyadh in which he danced with swords and let king salman and other corrupt persian gulf monarchs who have long winked and nodded at ideological and logistical support going to al qaeda and other islamic terror groups pretend their governments were joining an antiterror coalitionexploding the myth that he is at least a streetsmart operator who can t be easily conned trump added  in saudi arabia early last year i was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than  arab and muslim nations we agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the islamist extremism that inspires them no wonder netanyahu seemed so pleased with trump s speech the israeli prime minister could have written it himself while allowing trump to add a few crude flourishes like calling north korean leader kim jong un  rocket man   on a suicide mission  referring to  the loser terrorists  and declaring that many parts of the world are  going to hell trump also tossed in a plug for his  new strategy for victory  in afghanistan and threw in some interventionist talk regarding the western hemisphere with more threats to cuba and venezuela about escalating sanctions and other activities to achieve more  regime change  solutionsso what trump made clear in his un address is that his  america first  and  prosovereignty  rhetoric is simply cover for a set of policies that are indistinguishable from those pushed by the neocons of the bush administration or the liberal interventionists of the obama administration the rationalizations may change but the endless wars and  regime change  machinations continue

his first full day in office by michael snyder on november st  a couple of weeks ago it looked like hillary clinton was all set to cruise to victory  but now the fbi has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time a few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that trump might lose but i dont know who is going to win the election and so all i had to go on was the cold hard numbers and a couple of weeks ago the cold hard numbers were telling me that hillary clinton was going to win of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for trump so things didnt look good for trump at the time but now that the fbi has renewed their investigation into hillary clintons emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in trumps favor  as i write this article the national polls have really tightened up in fact the latest abc newswashington post tracking poll puts trump  point ahead of clinton trump has all of the momentum at the moment but that does not mean that he is going to win as we have seen already in this race one day can literally change everything and as i noted yesterday  more than  million americans have already voted and most of that voting was done during a period of time when hillary clinton was doing very well in the polls so we shall see what happens but if trump does win on november th there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention donald trump was born on june th  if you move ahead  years from that date that brings you to june th  moving forward another  months brings you to january th  and moving forward another  days brings you to january st  and if donald trump wins the election january st will be his first full day in office of course trump would be inaugurated on january th but he would only be president for part of that day so that means that donald trump would be  years  months and  days old on his first full day as president of the united states and this would happen during year  on the hebrew calendar these amazing coincidences were first pointed out on facebook by a user named alyson kelly some may take these numbers as a sign that donald trump is supposed to become the next president but i want to make it exceedingly clear that i do not know what is going to happen nor am i making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen i just thought that this information was interesting and so i thought that i would share it someone that does believe that trump is going to win is glenn beck he was been virulently antitrump throughout this campaign but now he is convinced that clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal and he is calling this renewed investigation by the fbi the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of america beck also says that if clinton wins now it will be evidence that magic exists and he is currently projecting that trump should win the national vote by  points  lets just say he was  points that was fair to say  points behind last week beck said according to a transcript posted on his website  he should win by  points beck later added how can the next president face a possible collapsing economy possible war with russia and a current war with isis oh and also be under fbi investigation and indictment cant cant the conservative personality called the latest fbi revelation the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of america and added that if clinton still managed to win it would be akin to proof magic exists hopefully glenn beck is right because none of us should want to see hillary clinton in the white house she is the most evil corrupt and scandalridden politician of this generation and i cant understand how any american in their right mind could possibly vote for her and the hits just keep on coming wikileaks has just released an email in which john podesta told clinton fixer cheryl mills that they were going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later  it was not entirely clear what podesta meant by that phrase but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice  back in  barack obama was new intriguing and mysterious we didnt know a lot about him and so one can almost understand how the american people could have been fooled by him but in  americans know more about hillary clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern american history the clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the s but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway i believe that this election is americas final exam originally there were  republicans and  democrats running for the presidency when you throw in the major third party candidates that brings us to a total of approximately  people that the american public could have chosen from if the american people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed i dont think that anyone will be able to say that we dont deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision the time for talking is almost over and shortly we shall find out which path the american people have chosen if that choice turns out to be hillary clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle i truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation',\n",
       " 'the high cost of investing like a daredevil   the new york times live in the moment if youre skiing surfing or scuba diving thats the way to go but if youre investing that approach can lead to disaster the numbers show that most people who are lucky enough to have money to invest end up underperforming the markets by staggering margins a big reason for that is living in the moment     acting in response to ephemeral events most of us would be much better off we focused relentlessly on the far horizon sticking with a simple and cheap plan for getting there when investors think   and try to time the market they havent done very well louis s harvey the president of dalbar a boston research firm said in an interview they have been leaving a lot of money on the table  his company has been chronicling mutual fund investors efforts to beat financial markets for many years and it has found that as a group typical investors almost invariably lose the numbers are devastating for the two decades through december dalbar found the actual annualized return for the average stock mutual fund investor was only   percent   percentage points lower than the   percent return for the standard  poors   index bond investors did even worse trailing the benchmark barclays aggregate bond index by   percentage points in isolation these figures which arent adjusted for inflation may seem small but they arent when they recur year after year in fact because of the effects of compounding     in which a positive return in one year adds to your stash and can grow further in subsequent years     those annualized numbers translate into   disparities consider a   investment in the s p  index using the dalbar rates my calculations show that with dividends that   would grow to   over  years compared with only   over the same period for the return of the average stock mutual fund investors that gap grows over time at those rates after  years with compounding the nest egg invested in the plain vanilla stock index would grow to about   compared with only   for the average returns of stock mutual fund investors a   difference disparities of this order have been showing up year after year in the dalbar numbers and with so many americans forced to rely on their own investing acumen because of the decline of traditional pension plans and lax government rules about financial advice these awful returns really matter why do typical mutual fund investors do so badly for multiple reasons and ive written about some of them in recent columns briefly actively managed mutual funds over long periods tend to underperform the market and as a group dont do markedly better than would be expected from flipping coins expenses eat into returns buying     and holding     a   index fund over an extended period would improve the returns of most people radically the dalbar numbers suggest thats where living in the moment comes in people tend to make big mistakes in periods of big up or down market moves when finance is in the news dalbar has found and while chasing better returns investors often buy into funds that dont match market returns once costs are included when you factor in those choices typical investors actually earn less in many cases much less     than mutual fund performance reports would suggest the dalbar report says by buying and selling too frequently and at the wrong times and not benefiting fully from compounding people typically do even worse than they would have done if they simply held on to their investments     even if those investments were in mutual funds that themselves trailed the market dalbar found in short investors have been penalized multiple times     for buying funds that underperform for selling those funds at the wrong times and often by generating unnecessary costs by trading relatively frequently some clues as to why this happens year after year appear when you review   market returns i did that using historical data from morningstars ibbotson unit i examined the monthly returns of a large capitalization stock index and an index modeling the   united states treasury market over hundreds of rolling       and   periods going back to  i also looked at the blended returns of those two indexes in simple asset allocation portfolios on the positive side the numbers show the beneficial effects of simply buying and holding portfolios based on the simplest and most straightforward of plain vanilla market indexes over long periods over   periods if investors had been patient enough to wait that long they could have had remarkably consistent favorable returns as the dalbar study suggests over short stretches though the data shows that the pure stock portfolio produced   variations looking at these numbers its no wonder that investors have been alternately frightened and enticed driving up their own costs by shifting their holdings incessantly into hot funds usually at inopportune times but if you had lengthened your perspective it would have been easier to stay in the market as the holding periods extended the growth in the   portfolio became more consistent the   stock portfolio after  years of compounding ranged in size from a bonanza of   in the two decades through march  to the modest sum of   in the  years through august  in every rolling   period     and there were  of them     the returns were positive bond returns were generally lower but steadier and when you mixed bonds with stocks as modern portfolio theory suggests you should you had extremely smooth returns in fact a simple portfolio composed of  percent stocks and  percent bonds never produced a loss over any   stretch in nearly  years the average annual return for those periods was nearly  percent and it was more than  percent for the   periods it isnt hard to set up a portfolio like this either it can be done by buying   index funds either as   funds or mutual funds and rebalancing them every so often many asset allocation funds will do all the work for you investors can diversify further by including foreign stocks and bonds but as john rekenthaler vice president for research at morningstar said in an interview its not just about buying hot mutual funds its important not to chase hot asset classes either   and steady both of them are important  but to pull off a strategy like this you would need to ignore the moment and take the long view if you had done that you would have beaten most investors and most comparable mutual funds and you would have an impressive stash past performance definitely does not guarantee future returns and this approach might not work as well over the next five  or  years but its a baseline im not sure that anything else is better at least not for those of us who dont invest full time the beauty of this method is that it can be accomplished at low cost by anyone with enough money and discipline or obliviousness to take a really long view live in the moment by all means but invest in the future',\n",

in  testified on tuesday that he was told that gov chris christie of new jersey and gov andrew m cuomo of new york had agreed to falsely explain the closings as part of a traffic study to try to put an end to a growing scandal surrounding them the confessed culprit david wildstein testified that he had heard from two top christie appointees at the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates the bridge that the governors had hoped to stop the catastrophic traffic jams caused by the lane closings from hurting mr christies   campaign mr wildstein who is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the trial of two former christie aides accused of approving and directing the   scheme agreed that mr cuomo had told the port authoritys executive director to stand down from trying to publicly blame mr christie and his aides for the closings at least until mr christie had won   in november  a spokesman for mr cuomo issued a statement sternly denying that the governor and mr christie had discussed a false story and denouncing mr wildsteins motivations mr christie a republican and mr cuomo a democrat have previously denied that such a conversation occurred both have said they had no role in covering up the cause of the lane closings the testimony by mr wildstein a former christie administration official at the port authority left open the possibility that mr cuomo did not know the true reason for the closings mr wildstein has said they were meant to punish a mayor who did not endorse mr christies   but mr wildstein testified previously that mr christie knew about the closings and their punitive intent as they happened and that the governor laughed when he heard about the traffic jam and that the mayors calls about public safety risks were being ignored on tuesday his seventh day on the witness stand mr wildstein was   by a lawyer for bridget anne kelly a former deputy chief of staff to mr christie who is on trial with bill baroni mr christies former top staff appointee at the port authority mr wildstein testified that top officials in the governors office and david samson mr christies appointee as port authority chairman had decided that new jersey officials at the agency would write a report trying to legitimize the traffic study story the report mr wildstein said would seek to dismiss the mayors complaints by saying there had been a failure of communication  mr christies office would review the report he said and the authoritys executive director patrick j foye appointed by mr cuomo would approve it mr foye had ordered the lanes reopened when he learned about the shutdown four days after it began and had never been a fan of mr wildstein mr foye knew the lane closings were not related to a traffic study and at least one of his staff members had called reporters to say so generating intense coverage of the closings and why they happened but mr foye agreed to sign off on the report mr wildstein said in court on tuesday as long as new jersey took responsibility my understanding at the time was that this would put an end to this issue mr wildstein testified referring to the report by the two governors pat foye would sign off on a false report ms kellys lawyer michael critchley asked him yes sir that was my understanding mr wildstein said and that was a result of conversations with cuomo and christie mr critchley said yes sir mr wildstein said mr cuomos office mr wildstein said had told mr foye to lay off christie  mr wildstein who has pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closings acknowledged that his account was secondhand he said he had heard about the conversations from mr samson and mr baroni mr cuomos office on tuesday denied that any such conversation had taken place whatever the admitted bridgegate architect thought or dreamt about new yorks involvement has no basis in fact john p l kelly a spokesman for mr cuomo said in a statement anyone can say anything especially a convicted felon spinning a tale but its just false and delusional  no report was ever issued federal prosecutors and mr wildstein have said that was because mr baroni was asked to give testimony to a new jersey legislative committee and he read a version of the report there mr wildstein also testified that mr baroni told him that kevin odowd mr christies chief of staff had had a conversation with his counterpart in mr cuomos office lawrence s schwartz in which they agreed that mr foye who had also been invited to testify at that hearing would not mr wildstein said he was also told by mr christies spokesman michael drewniak that he had briefed mr odowd on what new jersey officials took to be mr foyes meddling in their business ms kellys lawyer asked what that meant that governor christie was in the middle of an election that mr foye was becoming involved and could potentially hurt governor christie and that mr odowd now understood and had reached out to albany to get foye to back off mr wildstein replied mr foye did not testify at the legislative hearing but later accepted another invitation to speak to the legislature eric corngold a lawyer for mr foye said on tuesday that mr wildsteins testimony on this topic is not accurate  mr foye never had any such conversations or was given any such direction by the governor or any of his staff mr corngold continued the day after mr christie won   the wall street journal reported that mr wildstein had been behind the order to close the lanes mr wildstein testified that he believed mr cuomos direction to stand down as mr critchley said did not extend

       " 'case study in chaos how management experts grade a trump white house  the new york times for someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an organizational genius as anderson cooper of cnn put it it has been a rocky white house debut for donald j trump the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the oval office chaos seems to be the word most often invoked closely followed by turmoil  one exception the white house spokesman sean spicer who said he preferred    in less than two weeks mr trump created upheaval at the nations borders alienated longtime allies roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced the conservative editorial page of the wall street journal bemoaned a refugee policy so poorly explained and prepared for that it has produced confusion and fear at airports an immediate legal defeat and political fury at home and abroad  even the top house republican speaker paul d ryan who had released a statement praising the immigration order later distanced himself saying its regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout  all new presidents undergo a learning curve but mr trump promised a seamless transition and with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician an administration that would function as a   machine so it doesnt seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of mr trumps first weeks purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness as i did this week the unanimous verdict thus far the trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch this is so basic its covered in the introduction to the m b a program that all our students take said lindred greer an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the stanford graduate school of business by all outward indications mr trump desperately needs to take the course she said jeffrey pfeffer professor of organizational behavior at stanford and the author of power why some people have it and others dont said mr trumps executive actions as president are so far from any responsible management approach that they all but defy analysis of course this isnt new he told me his campaign also violated every prudent management principle everyone including our friends on wall street somehow believed that once he was president hed change i dont understand that logic  wall street did take notice after months of cheering the prospect of tax reform and infrastructure spending investors sold stocks after a weekend of chaos at the nations airports connected to the presidents executive order on immigration on monday the dow industrials experienced the biggest   decline since the election fueled by worries that a dysfunctional white house wouldnt be able to execute mr trumps policies if you thought immigration was bad just wait for health care mr pfeffer warned the white house did not respond to requests for comment there is an enormous amount of literature and data exploring what constitutes effective management of complicated organizations the core principles have served many leaders really well said jeffrey t polzer professor of human resource management at harvard business school its really common sense you want to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a   solution  this is often easier said than done it requires an openness to being challenged and some   and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do mr polzer continued this doesnt mean decisions are made by consensus the person at the top makes the decisions but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision  mr trump has already violated several of these core principles the secretary of homeland security john f kelly was still discussing a proposed executive order restricting immigration when mr trump went ahead and signed it nor was jim mattis the defense secretary consulted he saw the final order only hours before it went into effect not to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order is insane since they have the expertise and should be on top of the data ms greer said ignoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing  and theres another reason to consult mr polzer said when people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities even if the decision doesnt go their way  conversely people who arent consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome far from encouraging and weighing differing views as part of the   process mr trump appears to view dissension as disloyalty after career state department officers circulated a draft cable questioning the effectiveness of the immigration ban mr spicer responded they should either get with the program or they can go  debate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome ms greer said comments like mr spicers will discourage anyone from speaking up you end up with group think an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear  and while its understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises     he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on day      his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through some had to be reframed talk of a mexican border surcharge or significantly modified and clarified after the fact immigration policy i asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of mr trumps policies but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked when youre on the receiving end of a policy decision the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand mr polzer said if either one is done poorly the outcomes will be bad even good plans that are poorly rolled out arent going to work well  for many people the affordable care act was indelibly tainted by the computer malfunctions that plagued its start similarly for many americans the enduring image of mr trumps immigration policy will be that of a tearful iraqi immigrant who was detained at kennedy international airport after risking his life working as a translator for the american military over a   period he was released after lawyers intervened on his behalf that prompted even mr ryan to say no one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas like translators get caught up in all of this  some trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past but every expert i consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool im not aware of anyone who advocates that mr polzer said i dont really know whats going on in the white house so i dont feel comfortable commenting on that specifically but i can say in general that in organizational settings less chaos is a good thing  everyone agreed that there was still time for mr trump to right the ship other administrations have had course corrections and personnel   but having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising if this were the private sector someone would be fired ms greer said that seems highly unlikely since mr trump has not even acknowledged a problem instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the white house that is a fundamental problem mr pfeffer said no good business makes decisions that are based

reputation internationally by caving in to a largely neoconservative and globalist foreign policy agenda as author james petras explains james petras information clearing house over the past quarter century progressive writers activists and academics have followed a trajectory from left to right   with each presidential campaign seeming to move them further to the right beginning in the  s progressives mobilized millions in opposition to wars voicing demands for the transformation of the us s corporate forprofit medical system into a national medicare for all public program they condemned the notorious wall street swindlers and denounced police state legislation and violence but in the end they always voted for democratic party presidential candidates who pursued the exact opposite agendaover time this political contrast between program and practice led to the transformation of the progressives and what we see today are us progressives embracing and promoting the politics of the far rightto understand this transformation we will begin by identifying who and what the progressives are and describe their historical role we will then proceed to identify their trajectory over the recent decadeswe will outline the contours of recent presidential campaigns where progressives were deeply involvedwe will focus on the dynamics of political regression from resistance to submission from retreat to surrenderwe will conclude by discussing the end result the progressives  largescale longterm embrace of farright ideology and practiceprogressives by name and postureprogressives purport to embrace  progress  the growth of the economy the enrichment of society and freedom from arbitrary government central to the progressive agenda was the end of elite corruption and good governance based on democratic proceduresprogressives prided themselves as appealing to  reason diplomacy and conciliation  not brute force and wars they upheld the sovereignty of other nations and eschewed militarism and armed interventionprogressives proposed a vision of their fellow citizens pursuing incremental evolution toward the  good society  free from the foreign entanglements which had entrapped the people in unjust warsprogressives in historical perspectivein the early part of the th century progressives favored political equality while opposing extraparliamentary social transformations they supported gender equality and environmental preservation while failing to give prominence to the struggles of workers and african americansthey denounced militarism in general but supported a series of wars to end all wars  theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson embodied the dual policies of promoting peace at home and bloody imperial wars overseas by the middle of the th century different strands emerged under the progressive umbrella progressives split between traditional good government advocates and modernists who backed socioeconomic reforms civil liberties and rightsprogressives supported legislation to regulate monopolies encouraged collective bargaining and defended the bill of rightsprogressives opposed wars and militarism in theory  until their government went to warlacking an effective third political party progressives came to see themselves as the left wing of the democratic party allies of labor and civil rights movements and defenders of civil libertiesprogressives joined civil rights leaders in marches but mostly relied on legal and electoral means to advance african american rightsprogressives played a pivotal role in fighting mccarthyism though ultimately it was the secretary of the army and the military high command that brought senator mccarthy to his kneesprogressives provided legal defense when the social movements disrupted the house unamerican activities committeethey popularized the legislative arguments that eventually outlawed segregation but it was courageous afroamerican leaders heading mass movements that won the struggle for integration and civil rightsin many ways the progressives complemented the mass struggles but their limits were defined by the constraints of their membership in the democratic partythe alliance between progressives and social movements peaked in the late sixties to mid s when the progressives followed the lead of dynamic and advancing social movements and community organizers especially in opposition to the wars in indochina and the military draftthe retreat of the progressivesby the late  s the progressives had cut their anchor to the social movements as the antiwar civil rights and labor movements lost their impetus and directionthe numbers of progressives within the left wing of the democratic party increased through recruitment from earlier social movements paradoxically while their  numbers  were up their caliber had declined as they sought to  fit in  with the probusiness prowar agenda of their president s partywithout the pressure of the  populist street  the progressivesturneddemocrats adapted to the corporate culture in the party the progressives signed off on a fatal compromise the corporate elite secured the electoral party while the progressives were allowed to write enlightened manifestos about the candidates and their programs    which were quickly dismissed once the democrats took office yet the ability to influence the  electoral rhetoric  was seen by the progressives as a sufficient justification for remaining inside the democratic partymoreover the progressives argued that by strengthening their presence in the democratic party their selfproclaimed boring from within strategy they would capture the party membership neutralize the procorporation militarist elements that nominated the president and peacefully transform the party into a  vehicle for progressive changes upon their successful  deep penetration  the progressives now cut off from the increasingly disorganized mass social movements coopted and bought out many prominent black labor and civil liberty activists and leaders while collaborating with what they dubbed the more malleable centrist democrats these mythical creatures were really procorporate democrats who condescended to occasionally converse with the progressives while working for the wall street and pentagon elitethe retreat of the progressives the clinton decadeprogressives adapted the  crab strategy  moving sideways and then backwards but never forwardprogressives mounted candidates in the presidential primaries which were predictably defeated by the corporate party apparatus and then submitted immediately to the outcome the election of president  bill  clinton launched a period of unrestrained financial plunder major wars of aggression in europe yugoslavia and the middle east iraq a military intervention in somalia and secured israel s victory over any remnant of a secular palestinian leadership as well as its destruction of lebanonprogressives followed clinton s deep throated thrust toward the far right as he outsourced manufacturing jobs to mexico nafta and reappointed federal reserve s free market ayn randfanatic alan greenspanlike a huge collective  monica lewinsky  robot the progressives in the democratic party bent over and swallowed clinton s vicious  savaging of the venerable glass steagall act thereby opening the floodgates for massive speculation on wall street through the previously regulated banking sector when president clinton gutted welfare programs forcing single mothers to take minimumwage jobs without provision for safe childcare millions of poor white and minority women were forced to abandon their children to dangerous makeshift arrangements in order to retain any residual public support and access to minimal health care progressives looked the other wayprogressives repeatedly kneeled before president clinton marking their submission to the democrats   hard right  policiesthe election of republican president g w bush  permitted progressive s to temporarily trot out and burnish their antiwar antiwall street credentials out in the street they protested bush s savage invasion of iraq but not the destruction of afghanistan they protested the media reports of torture in abu ghraib under bush but not the massive bombing and starvation of millions of iraqis that had occurred under clinton progressives protested the expulsion of immigrants from mexico and central america but were silent over the brutal uprooting of refugees resulting from us wars in iraq and afghanistan or the systematic destruction of their nations  infrastructureprogressives embraced israel s bombing jailing and torture of palestinians by voting unanimously in favor of increasing the annual  billion dollar military handouts to the brutal jewish state they supported israel s bombing and slaughter in lebanonprogressives were in retreat but retained a muffled voice and inconsequential vote in favor of peace justice and civil liberties they kept a certain distance from the worst of the police state decrees by the republican administrationprogressives and obama from retreat to surrenderwhile progressives maintained their tepid commitment to civil liberties and their highly  leveraged  hopes for peace in the middle east they jumped uncritically into the highly choreographed democratic party campaign for barack obama  wall street s first black president progressives had given up their quest to  realign  the democratic party from within  they turned from serious tourism to permanent

       " 'senators push to broaden inquiry on election hacking  the new york times washington     pressure mounted on sunday for a broader congressional investigation of russian cyberattacks aimed at influencing the american election even as a top aide to   donald j trump said there was no conclusive evidence of foreign interference the effort was being led by a bipartisan group of senators including john mccain republican of arizona and chuck schumer of new york the senate democratic leader who called on sunday for the creation of a senate select committee on cyberactivity to take the investigative lead on capitol hill recent reports of russian interference in our election should alarm every american the senators wrote on sunday in a letter to senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader who has said a select committee is not necessary cybersecurity is the ultimate   challenge and we must take a comprehensive approach to meet this challenge effectively  the developments served to deepen the fissures between   lawmakers of both parties who see american intelligence reports implicating russia as the basis for additional inquiries and mr trump who continues to reject the conclusions of those reports but the developments also put new strain on mr mcconnell he now faces calls from mr mccain and lindsey graham two senate republicans considered well versed on national security issues to form a select committee if he were to reject that appeal he would be subject to criticism that he was trying to avoid a spotlight on an issue that senators in both parties believe is worthy of more focused scrutiny mr mcconnell said last week that while he respects the intelligence agencies conclusions the senate intelligence committee is more than capable of conducting a complete review itself he also acknowledged that mr mccain could conduct an investigation on the armed services committee an option that remains open should mr mcconnell decide against a select committee those divisions coming as the electoral college prepares to meet on monday to ratify mr trumps election and the   completes his cabinet choices all but ensured that the issue would cloud the first months of mr trumps presidency when he will be asking congress to approve an aggressive legislative agenda several permanent congressional committees have already been tasked with examining various aspects of the russian interference which has been largely accepted as fact by most members of congress but in their letter on sunday the lawmakers argued the issue was too important and complicated for an existing committee to take on properly we share your respect for and deference to the regular order of the senate and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request the senators wrote to mr mcconnell however we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem  in addition to undertaking a comprehensive investigation of russian interference the senators recommended that such a committee also develop comprehensive recommendations and as necessary new legislation to modernize our nations laws governmental organization and related practices to meet this challenge  select committees which are typically created to examine a particular issue for a limited time are rarely formed the most prominent recent example is the house select committee on the attacks in  on the american diplomatic compound in benghazi libya an inquiry that democrats have denounced as unduly partisan speaker paul d ryan said last week that the house intelligence committee would continue its own examination of russian hacking mr schumer said in a news conference on sunday that they intended to avoid such charges of partisanship we dont want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another mr schumer said we want to find out what the russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system and then figure out a way to stop it  a spokesman for mr mcconnell david popp referred to mr mcconnells earlier comments and said the majority leader would be reviewing the latest letter the letter was also signed by mr graham republican of south carolina and senator jack reed democrat of rhode island two members of the senate armed services committee that mr mccain leads it follows a signed statement from the lawmakers released last week warning that any congressional investigation into the hacks cannot become a partisan issue  mr trump for his part has sought to paint the intelligence communitys conclusions about the matter as just that     a partisan attack against him he said last week that the reports were just another excuse by democrats frustrated with the election results that might be used to try to undermine his victory asked on cbss face the nation on sunday what information mr trump had received that led him to reject intelligence assessments kellyanne conway one of mr trumps top advisers insisted that the reports about the hacking were groundless where is the evidence ms conway asked turning the question around why when c i a officials were invited to a house intelligence briefing last week did they refuse to go robert m gates the former defense secretary under president obama and president george w bush who has offered counsel to mr trump speculated on nbcs meet the press that the   felt the way this information came out through newspaper stories and so on was somehow intended to delegitimize his victory in the election and that hes reacting to that rather than the facts on the ground as it were  but mr gates also said the russian hacking was aimed at discrediting the american electoral process whether or not it was intended to help one candidate or another i dont know said mr gates who also served as c i a director under president george bush but i think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections and i think it was aimed certainly at weakening mrs clinton  mr obama in a news conference on friday vowed that the united states would respond to the attack he said that he was still weighing a mix of covert and public actions to retaliate before he leaves office and lawmakers from both parties have proposed new sanctions to punish russia speaking sunday on cnns state of the union mr mccain sought to add urgency to the matter theres no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks he said of the russians the question now is how much and what damage and what should the united states of america do and so far we have been totally paralyzed  mr mccain said that he had faith that reality is going to intercede at one point or another on mr trump suggesting that the   might come to agree about russian influence asked on cbs about mr obamas pledge of retaliation ms conway said mr trump respects mr obamas right to respond as he sees fit for the remainder of his presidency but she added that doesnt mean that new president trump will agree with it and continue it  it does seem to be a political response at this point because it seems like the president is under pressure from team hillary who cant accept the election results she said',\n",

       " 'miamis cuban exiles celebrate castros death  the new york times miami     it did not matter that it was the middle of the night or that it began to drizzle when this citys   residents heard the news they sprinted to little havana they banged pots and pans they sang the cuban national anthem and waved the cuban flag they danced and hugged laughed and cried shouted and rejoiced the seemingly eternal vigil for the death of fidel castro a man who had profoundly changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people here     dividing their families taking their property imprisoning and sometimes shooting their friends and relatives wrenching them from their homes and their country     was over finally i owe this to my dad     this going out and celebrating said isabel de lara  a former banker who came to calle ocho     eighth street     to join in the jubilation she wished her father who is dead could have joined her more than five decades had passed since ms de lara stepped off a plane alone from cuba sent here at age  by parents who feared for her future after the castro revolution for her and so many others mr castros death was a watershed for he embodied the revolution and the heartbreak that followed him dying represents the end of something awful that happened to us she said its actually him     not anybody else     who caused this its because of him that we lost our opportunity to have a life in our country  waves of other cubans also came transforming not just their own lives but the city itself gradually turning it into the unofficial bilingual capital of latin america with the goal of ousting mr castro and establishing democracy in cuba early exiles built a degree of political and economic clout that outstripped their relatively small numbers focusing first on local politics and business in the s and s the exiles and their children led by the powerful cuban american national foundation catapulted into national politics and influence they gained the power to tilt presidential elections toward republicans and sway american foreign policy against appeasement with mr castro it was important to take the struggle outside of eighth street to washington said jorge mas santos the son of jorge mas canosa the man who spearheaded the foundation and was seen as the leader of miamis exile community that influence remains the american trade embargo on cuba is still in force requiring the vote of a congress that is reluctant to remove it and this years presidential campaign saw two americans of cuban descent     senators marco rubio and ted cruz     run for the office but in the last decade the     grip on the minds and votes of people in miami and elsewhere has weakened creating divisions among   over how deeply to engage with cuba and its people with mr castros death some   are pushing for retrenchment and hope that   donald j trump will crack down now that the government has lost its father figure others say that this is the time to flood the zone with more people ideas and goods cubas president ral castro has opened the window slightly to economic reform travel and american influence now that his older brother is gone they argue he will be freer to make changes but the oldest and most vehement exiles     the historicos as they are called     are dying off in large numbers their children while still passionately opposed to mr castro are open to closer ties with the cuban people as a way of stoking change even mr mas santos is part of this group and their grandchildren know far less about cuba and mr castro many are more intrigued than outraged at the same time recent arrivals while deeply disenchanted with the cuban government want to see and help their relatives on the island above all else those shifts in attitude have been translated in washington two years ago president obama surprised   by announcing a series of changes he   diplomatic ties and made it easier for americans to visit and send money and goods and also for american businesses to establish a foothold we have moved from a politics of passion to a politics of realism said andy gomez a political analyst who was a senior fellow in cuban studies at the university of miami we are going to be passionate for the next  hours but the realism is that the transition has to come within the island the leadership has to come from within the island i dont think anyone in south florida thinks they will be president of cuba and if they do they are fools  but saturday was mostly a day to celebrate overnight thousands including ms de lara joined an impromptu conga line of catharsis in front of versailles restaurant on eighth street the unofficial headquarters of miamis cuban exiles so many people showed up including scores of young people that the police at the mayors request closed off several blocks to accommodate the celebration erick and janette revuelta stood outside versailles toasting mr castros death with small cups of cuban coffee they had come from the st augustine fla area to celebrate thanksgiving with family mr revuelta  came to america by raft when he was  along with his father and two brothers in  just before president bill clinton signed the agreement with cuba that allowed refugees to stay only if they reached dry land the   wet foot dry foot policy his mother immigrated several years later mr revuelta also came to calle ocho when rumors of mr castros death previously spread i was here last time he died he said its been a long time coming  antonio rodgriguez  left the island in  shortly after he was imprisoned for three months after speaking against the government he took a dimmer view he died but his brother is still there the government is still there its still the oppressive government mr rodgriguez said vivian   castell  was  when she came to the united states from havana thinking her stay would be temporary in the early hours of saturday she wept after hearing the news changed out of her pajamas and joined the caravan to little havana she danced in the middle of the street hugging strangers as car horns blared but there was an overlay of sadness ms castell knew so many people who had waited for this day their entire lives and many of them had died before it came there was such sadness to think of all the people and what everyone went through and the people who arent here today to celebrate and witness this she said my brother who was in the bay of pigs he couldnt enjoy it the way i am the people they killed the people who drowned on the way over here  in miami the   convulsion had long been talked about rumored and planned for once the city and county had a contingency plan to address a possible mass exodus of cubans from the island to miami that is no longer anticipated but many schools have a    plan and police departments were prepared for what to do     in miami this meant letting the people celebrate the fact that mr castros death came during a long holiday weekend made the news more manageable in many ways luis lasa  a retired banker watched events unfold on television from his home but it felt no less emotional it was a lifetime ago that his father an executive for an american company in cuba got a call from a military office on oct   warning him to leave the country he left that night and the family followed the next day mr lasa was  years old they destroyed our families they destroyed our traditions said mr lasa who lost a cousin in the bungled bay of pigs invasion forget the property that we lost we had been in cuba  years we lost so much there  on saturday for so many exiles it finally became easier to look forward and not back fidel castro even in his old age remained the symbol of the revolution ral castro ruled but always in his older brothers shadow exiles said without fidel castro cuba can exhale even though change may not come quickly there is a strong possibility it will come this is the beginning of the end mr lasa said',\n",

monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign think about that for a moment one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds where do we draw the line though elias suggests a particularly intricate solution if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and

       " 'championing optimism obama hails clinton as his political heir  the new york times philadelphia     president obama delivered a stirring valedictory address at the democratic convention wednesday night hailing hillary clinton as his rightful political heir and the partys best hope to protect democracy from homegrown demagogues like the republican donald j trump taking the stage to rapturous roars of we love you and yes we can mr obama acknowledged that democrats were still divided after a bruising nomination fight and that mrs clinton had made mistakes  but he vouched passionately for mrs clinton as a trusted and reliable ally not just for him but for all americans who need a fighter to improve their lives and keep them safe shes been there for us     even if we havent always noticed     and if youre serious about our democracy you cant afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue mr obama said an explicit appeal to supporters of senator bernie sanders who continue to resist mrs clinton mr obama offered an optimistic portrait of america and a strong defense of his policies but also unleashed by far his most ferocious attack yet on mr trump even portraying the republican nominee as a threat to the country thats why anyone who threatens our values whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues will always fail in the end he said in the most unmistakable declaration yet by mrs clinton that she is effectively seeking mr obamas third term she strolled on stage after his speech and embraced the president as the delegates roared it was a tableau of continuity and a vivid illustration of how dependent the two former rivals are on each other now mr obama also used his own remarks to try to drive a wedge between mr trumps campaign and republican voters it wasnt particularly republican and it sure wasnt conservative he said of last weeks republican convention there were no serious solutions to pressing problems just the fanning of resentments and blame and hate and anger  the presidents contempt for mr trump took on a personal dimension as well when he recalled his grandparents from kansas and said i dont know if they had their birth certificates     a reference to mr trumps leadership of the   birther movement that raised questions about mr obamas citizenship wednesday signaled a transition for the party emotion suffused the convention hall some delegates in tears were not ready to say goodbye to mr obama yet and others     particularly some liberals and young democrats     were not ready to accept mrs clinton as their new leader as she prepares to give her nomination acceptance speech on thursday night the left wing of the party still remains divided while many republicans appear ready to fall in line behind mr trump mr obamas speech a passionate defense of mrs clintons vision and character did not itself herald the start of new political era mrs clinton has wrapped herself in the cloth of the obama presidency rather than break with him and offer a new path like vice president george bushs promise of a kinder gentler nation in  after the reagan years instead the lineup on wednesday reflected a party attempting to rally its own partisans and attract republicans with blunt warnings that whatever they may think about the new democratic   they must all do their duty to thwart mr trump and the convention speeches were full of   appeals as senator tim kaine the democratic   nominee offered republicans a home if they felt mr trump did not represent the party of lincoln and former mayor michael r bloomberg of new york urged independents to vote for a sane competent person     mrs clinton mr kaine a   senator and a former governor of virginia introduced himself to his largest television audience yet as a product of a jesuit high school who embraced its motto     men for others     who held close to his faith while trying to help americans as a civil rights lawyer and then as a political leader whose most searing experience was the mass shooting at virginia tech in  he occasionally shifted to spanish which he speaks fluently and led the audience in a chant of an obama political slogan s se puede yes you can mr kaine paid brief tribute to republicans and also hailed senator bernie sanders whom mrs clinton defeated for the nomination at several points yet some sanders supporters were not willing to fall behind the new   nominee as mr kaine spoke jeers broke out from the utah delegation attacking the   partnership trade deal that the senator has supported and mr sanders is against     and mrs clinton has shifted to oppose placards denouncing the trade deal quickly spread through the hall including a couple of dozen in the california delegation leon e panetta the former defense secretary and c i a chief spoke early in the evening and was repeatedly interrupted with shouts of no more war from several state delegations that favored the candidacy of mr sanders during the presidential race as the heckling persisted mrs clintons supporters took up a   heard more often at the republican convention to drown out the jeers u s a u s a  mr obama and vice president joseph r biden jr also turned to images and language more commonly used by the right to depict mr trump as denigrating american greatness invoking patriotism and saluting military service before mr obama even entered the convention hall here the audience was clearly as devoted to him as they were excited for mrs clinton the first lady michelle obama was received with adoration and her speech on monday was the most   moment of the first days of the convention and even a quick flash of mr obamas face amid a procession of past presidents on the convention screen tuesday brought a burst of applause the president is also the strongest adhesive holding democrats together after five months of bitterly fought primary and caucus contests between mrs clinton and mr sanders of vermont according to a new york   poll earlier this month  percent of sanders supporters approved of mr obamas job performance after two nights of convention speeches focused on mrs clintons virtues and attempts to make peace with sanders supporters clinton campaign officials sought to address the threat of radical islamists     an omission early on that republicans had criticized and in a shift from only about a decade ago when they largely avoided the issue democrats used much of wednesday to advocate gun control sending relatives of those murdered in newtown conn and charleston s c as well as a former congresswoman gabrielle giffords to recount their stories but virtually all of the anticipation on wednesday surrounded mr obama and the symbolic passing of the torch to mrs clinton after she became the partys nominee on tuesday night mr obamas resounding endorsement of his   rival was the final consummation of a political alliance over a decade in the making since mrs clinton flew to chicago in  to raise money for a    state senator and discovered a phenom back then he was the one who benefited from the imprimatur of a   political star and her support continued to prove critical over the years after he won the presidential nomination that she expected to be hers in  mrs clinton put aside her resentment and helped him unify a divided democratic party and later that year she again came to his aid by agreeing to become his first secretary of state mr obama is the one riding high now his approval rating over  percent and his image is only enhanced as voters view him in his final months as president through the prism of a race to replace him that features two deeply unpopular candidates while acknowledging that mrs clinton has her share of critics on the right and the left the president sought to transfer his prestige and political appeal to his long ago rival tonight i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me he said i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me  and if youre serious about our democracy you cant afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue youve got to get in the arena with her because democracy isnt a spectator sport america isnt about yes he will its about yes we can ',\n",

       " 'mother teresa is made a saint by pope francis  the new york times vatican city     she was known throughout the world as mother teresa considered a saint by many for her charitable work among the poorest of the worlds poor on sunday morning pope francis officially bestowed that title at her canonization ceremony in st peters square i think perhaps we may have some difficulty in calling her st teresa her holiness is so near to us so tender and so fruitful that we continue to spontaneously call her mother teresa the pope said in    remarks during his homily it was a festive atmosphere at the vatican under a broiling summer sun and several flags fluttered in the light breeze from albania representing the roman catholic nuns ethnic origins from macedonia to note her birthplace skopje from india where she spent most of her life working in the slums of kolkata and from the many other countries where her humility and selflessness touched countless lives when francis proclaimed her st teresa at the end of the formal ceremony in latin the crowd erupted in sustained applause we are proud of her all of india is proud said marina borneo sam who traveled from kolkata with her mother to be at the ceremony she may no longer be there but we still feel her spirit around us  for some mother teresas saintliness was so evident from the start that her canonization was just a formality for me nothing has changed said giovanna tommasi a lay member of the missionaries of charity the religious order founded by mother teresa in  when you were fortunate enough to know her as i did then todays celebration doesnt change much  the canonization was a highlight of the jubilee year which the pope had proclaimed to celebrate the theme of mercy and on sunday he called mother teresa a tireless worker of mercy  his homily was primarily addressed to volunteer workers celebrating the jubilee today i pass on this emblematic figure of womanhood and of consecrated life to the whole world of volunteers may she be your model of holiness francis said he also praised her defense of human life those unborn and those abandoned and discarded emphasizing her relentless petitioning against abortion mother teresa earned fame and accolades over a lifetime spent working with the poor and the sick and with orphans lepers and aids patients she made the cover of time magazine in december  for an article that acknowledged her as one of the worlds living saints  when told that she had won the nobel peace prize in  she said i am unworthy  a portrait of mother teresa described by pope john paul ii as an icon of the good samaritan was displayed on the facade of st peters basilica and showing her in her distinctive   white sari the portrait was commissioned by the knights of columbus and painted by chas fagan an american artist because of her celebrity she stepped where many religious figures do not she made her voice heard before the powers of this world so that they might recognize their guilt for the crime of poverty they created the pope said on sunday mother teresas supporters praise her selflessness and humility noting that though she associated with royalty government leaders and popes she continued to live simply until her death at age  in  she was one with us sister mary prema pierick the superior general of the missionaries of charity said at a vatican news conference on friday she never wanted or accepted anything not common with all the sisters  the order that mother teresa started with  nuns now numbers more than   people in  countries including two orders of brothers and one of priests the congregation continues her work of ministering to the worlds least privileged those she called the poorest of the poor  mother teresa was both mother and teacher sister prema said she lived the religious life with so much joy and enthusiasm that we all wanted to be close with her  her gift she added was to make everybody aware of their own responsibility and inspire people with the knowledge that each one of us can make a difference  mother teresa was canonized  years after her death remarkably fast for modern times john paul ii who is now also a saint went against protocol when he allowed the canonization process to begin two years after her death not the customary five he beatified her in  after a miracle the healing of a   woman was attributed to her intercession a second miracle recognized by francis last year opened the way to sanctity i am very grateful for this miracle said marcilio haddad andrino a brazilian who recovered from a   brain infection in  after his family prayed to mother teresa mr andrino came to rome for the ceremony and was present at the vatican news conference the merciful lord looks at us all without any distinction mr andrino said maybe it was me this time but maybe tomorrow it will be someone else  mother teresa for all her acclaim was not without critics some have questioned the hygiene and medical standards adopted by the sisters in some of the shelters and clinics run by the missionaries of charity others like dr aroup chatterjee have criticized what they call a cult of suffering that was prevalent in some of the homes run by the order in a book and in the documentary hells angel the author and essayist christopher hitchens accused mother teresa of being an ally of the status quo also calling her a zealot and a fanatic  mr hitchens charged that instead of empowering the poor to seek a better future she instilled the idea that their condition was permanent her campaigns against birth control and abortion which she once called the greatest destroyer of peace today angered feminists and raised concerns with aid organizations some doctors and officials in india have also challenged the narrative of monica besra the woman said to have benefited from mother teresas first miraculous intervention saying ms besra had been suffering from a cyst not a tumor mother teresa was born agnes gonxhe bojaxhiu in  to albanian parents in skopje then part of the ottoman empire and now the capital of macedonia today she is regarded as the citys most important native and celebrations for her canonization will be held there for a week skopje and the citizens of skopje will use this opportunity to thank the saint mother teresa and to continue on the path that she unselfishly showed us     the path toward understanding compassion and love said koce trajanovski the mayor of skopje where streets and clinics are named for her a memorial in her honor has attracted more than   visitors over the last five years the canonization was broadcast live on the vaticans television station and streamed online through a vatican website it was presented on vatican radio in seven languages including albanian tens of thousands of people gathered at st peters square on sunday along with  official government delegations including representatives of india and the united states the chief vatican spokesman greg burke said all   tickets that the holy see had made available had been distributed at st patricks cathedral in new york cardinal timothy m dolan looked out at the crowd that had filled the pews and remarked i thought st patricks would be empty this morning because when i was watching the mass this morning it looked like the whole catholic world was in st peters square  mr burke recalled a visit to the vatican press room that mother teresa made many years ago  shes not the only saint to have passed through here he said but there havent been many i think  she is the perfect saint for the year of mercy the rev brian kolodiejchuk the superior general of the missionary fathers of charity one of the religious institutes founded by mother teresa said on friday mother teresa was so aware of her need for mercy before god she was very much at home with her own poverty added father kolodiejchuk the chief promoter of her case for sainthood this year of mercy is first of all a reminder to all of us that before god we all stand in need of mercy so in this we are all poor ',\n",

       " ' hillary wrote this letter to superdelegates in  that bernie fans may find interesting bernie sanders supporters have been in an uproar about the democratic national committee s rules for primaries specifically the use of  superdelegates  a superdelegate is someone chosen by the party to represent their interests in a given state they are unpledged meaning they are able to vote for whoever they choose at the convention bernie sanders supporters especially the  bernie or bust  crowd   those who pledge to stay home or vote for trump if hillary gets the nomination   have decided that the use of superdelegates circumvents the democratic process making it impossible for anyone but an establishment democratic candidate to winlet s put that into perspective real quick if the rnc had the same rules they wouldn t be forced to nominate donald trumpsuperdelegates act in the best interest of the party there was a candidate in  who learned firsthand that superdelegates can make or break a candidacy her name was hillary clinton the expected nominee from the start of the primary season clinton found herself facetoface with the up and coming barack obama whose candidacy didn t truly flourish until half of the state primaries were over as he gained in popularity and it became clear that he was the right choice for america to succeed dubya those  corrupt  superdelegates tasked with securing the best interest of the party began switching their support to obama who was ultimately nominated by quorum call on the convention floor by none other than hillary clintonthat s the way these things work bernie or bust may be upset that all those independent voters didn t get to just walk into a democratic primary and vote but it really isn t anyone s fault but their own that they don t know the party rules primaries aren t general elections they re nominating processes controlled by the parties make no mistake if bernie sanders were in the lead or it looked like he was going to pull ahead those superdelegates would shift their support and make sure the nominee was someone the registered voters of the party want to supportwhen clinton was faced with the exact same scenario in  she wrote a letter to the superdelegates of the party with one last plea for support her arguments include things like who polled better against the gop who had spent more years arguing progressive causes and who was ultimately more qualified to execute the office of the presidentdear the stakes in this election are so high with two wars abroad our economy in crisis here at home and so many families struggling across america the need for new leadership has never been greaterat this point we do not yet have a nominee   and when the last votes are cast on june  neither senator obama nor i will have secured the nomination it will be up to automatic delegates like you to help choose our party s nominee and i would like to tell you why i believe i am the stronger candidate against senator mccain and would be the best president and commander in chiefvoters in every state have made it clear that they want to be heard and counted as part of this historic race and as we reach the end of the primary season more than  million people have supported me in my effort to become the democratic nominee   more people than have ever voted for a potential nominee in the history of our party in the past two weeks alone record numbers of voters participated in the west virginia and kentucky primaries and with  and  point margins of victory it is clear that even when voters are repeatedly told this race is over they re not giving up on me   and i am not giving up on them eitherafter seven years of feeling invisible to the bush administration americans are seeking a president who is strong experienced and ready to take on our toughest challenges from serving as commander in chief and ending the war in iraq to turning our economy around they want a president who shares their core beliefs about our country and its future and  gets  what they go through every day to care for their families pay the bills and try to put something away for the futurewe simply cannot afford another four   or eight   years in the wilderness that is why everywhere i go people come up to me grip my hand or arm and urge me to keep on running that is why i continue in this race because i believe i am best prepared to lead this country as president   and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock republicans have had on the electoral map and beat senator mccain in novemberrecent polls and election results show a clear trend i am ahead in states that have been critical to victory in the past two elections from ohio to pennsylvania to west virginia and beyond the results of recent primaries in battleground states show that i have strong support from the regions and demographics democrats need to take back the white house i am also currently ahead of senator mccain in gallup national tracking polls while senator obama is behind him and nearly all independent analyses show that i am in a stronger position to win the electoral college primarily because i lead senator mccain in florida and ohio i ve enclosed a detailed analysis of recent electoral and polling information and i hope you will take some time to review it carefullyin addition when the primaries are finished i expect to lead in the popular vote and in delegates earned through primaries ultimately the point of our primary process is to pick our strongest nominee   the one who would be the best president and commander in chief who has the greatest support from members of our party and who is most likely to win in november so i hope you will consider not just the strength of the coalition backing me but also that more people will have cast their votes for mei am in this race for them   for all the men and women i meet who wake up every day and work hard to make a difference for their families people who deserve a shot at the american dream   the chance to save for college a home and retirement to afford quality health care for their families to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left over each monthi am in this race for all the women in their nineties who ve told me they were born before women could vote and they want to live to see a woman in the white house for all the women who are energized for the first time and voting for the first time for the little girls   and little boys   whose parents lift them onto their shoulders at our rallies and whisper in their ears  see you can be anything you want to be  as the first woman ever to be in this position i believe i have a responsibility to themfinally i am in this race because i believe staying in this race will help unite the democratic party i believe that if senator obama and i both make our case   and all democrats have the chance to make their voices heard   everyone will be more likely to rally around the nomineein the end i am committed to unifying this party what senator obama and i share is so much greater than our differences and no matter who wins this nomination i will do everything i can to bring us together and move us forwardbut at this point neither of us has crossed the finish line i hope that in the time remaining you will think hard about which candidate has the best chance to lead our party to victory in november i hope you will consider the results of the recent primaries and what they tell us about the mindset of voters in the key battleground states i hope you will think about the broad and winning coalition of voters i have built and most important i hope you will think about who is ready to stand on that stage with senator mccain fight for the deepest principles of our party and lead our country forward into this new centurythe letter was followed by  pages of statistics showing that even though she was behind the race wasn t over in the end it was the support of superdelegates that gave obama the clear winas a bernie sanders supporter i would love to see the last melee of primaries go his way a big win in california and a couple of other states and there s a chance bernie becomes the best choice for the party at which time he can realistically try to woo the superdelegates away from clinton if hillary can hang on and secure the nomination those of us who care about the future of our country will put our full support behind herfeatured image by nbc

testify at his sentencing for murder a defense psychologist said as a hearing opened on monday in a court in pretoria south africa currently in my opinion he is not able to testify the psychologist jonathan scholtz told judge thokozile matilda masipa of the high court in pretoria arguing that mr pistorius should be hospitalized rather than imprisoned his condition is severe  under questioning from mr pistoriuss defense lawyer barry roux dr scholtz gave a largely sympathetic account of mr pistoriuss background personality and mental health dr scholtz said mr pistorius showed symptoms of depression anxiety and   stress disorder he also said mr pistorius was taking psychiatric medication and had problems with   memory gerrie nel the chief prosecutor rejected that argument saying that mr pistorius had not expressed remorse for the death of his girlfriend reeva steenkamp mr nel also questioned dr scholtzs assertion that mr pistorius was unable to testify given that mr pistorius recently gave an interview his first about the killing to the television network itv the interview is scheduled to be broadcast on june  which is probably after his sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of at least  years but the judge has discretion to render a lighter or tougher sentence the decision which is not expected until later this week will bring to a close a case that has riveted and divided south africa mr pistorius  was found guilty in december of murdering ms steenkamp after south africas top appeals court overturned a lower courts conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter the court found that the earlier conviction had been based on a misinterpretation of laws and an erroneous dismissal of circumstantial evidence the appeals court said mr pistorius who insists that he accidentally killed ms steenkamp under the mistaken belief that an intruder had broken into his home should have foreseen that his actions would kill someone he fired four shots through a locked bathroom door killing ms steenkamp who was on the other side in a country with a high crime rate the fear of home intrusion cuts across social and racial lines and high walls and security guards are common in gated communities like the one where mr pistorius lived in pretoria mr pistoriuss arrest in the killing of ms steenkamp on feb   sent south africans reeling known as the blade runner for the flexible   prosthetic legs he used when competing mr pistorius achieved worldwide fame by challenging   athletes most notably at the  london games he won medals at the   and  summer paralympics ms steenkamp who was  at the time of her death was a model a law school graduate and a budding   star in september      after a lengthy and highly publicized trial that was likened to the   trial of o j simpson in the united states     judge masipa convicted mr pistorius of culpable homicide but found him not guilty of murder she found that prosecutors had failed to present strong circumstantial evidence and to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mr pistorius had shown intent to kill prosecutors and ms steenkamps family argued that mr pistorius had deliberately killed his girlfriend after an argument although mr pistorius was regarded as a hero to many in south africa the trial revealed another darker side a man with a mercurial temper given to jealousy and occasional anger an aggressive driver an irresponsible gun owner and a celebrity who was used to getting his way in their appeal prosecutors argued that judge masipa had misinterpreted a crucial legal concept in finding mr pistorius not guilty of murder they argued that under a legal principle known as dolus eventualis mr pistorius should be found guilty because he should have known that firing through the locked door would kill the person inside the supreme court of appeal in bloemfontein agreed mr pistorius was released from prison in october after serving one year of the   sentence for manslaughter and he has been living under house arrest dr scholtz called mr pistoriuss relationship with ms steenkamp a normal loving relationship with no signs of abuse or coercion  dr scholtz said that mr pistorius has found some solace in the belief that the deceased is with god and that he was enrolled in a degree program at the university of london he argued that further incarceration would not be psychologically or socially constructive and that mr pistorius was not a threat to society mr pistorius once a gun enthusiast has sold his firearms dr scholtz said he is adamant that he never wants to touch or handle a firearm again the psychiatrist said but mr nel who   dr scholtz suggested that mr pistorius had not expressed remorse does he understand that he committed murder mr nel

positions in fact most independents arent independent at all they hold clear partisan preferences but they utterly refuse to identify with their preferred partywe find that many americans are largely ashamed of the dysfunction in washington rather than associate with candidates and politicians who are portrayed by media as stubborn and aggressive a plurality of americans would rather present an image of calm cool independence not only are americans likely to present themselves as independent but they also prefer that others do the same vox  that limits a thirdparty or independent candidates chances  more from klar and krupnikov in order for political independents to rise up and elect a thirdparty candidate two things would have to occur first people who say they are independent would have to truly believe that neither of the two parties can effectively represent them second the group of people who report that they are independent would have to have sufficiently coherent interests so as to coalesce around the same candidate both of these criteria suggest it is unlikely that people who call themselves independents will move america toward a third party vox  obama finishes up

frustrated president trump turned to his two top aides and told them he had had enough of their incessant   in the media work this out mr trump said according to two people briefed on the exchange the admonition was aimed at stephen k bannon the tempestuous chief strategist and reince priebus the   chief of staff over a series of   with jared kushner the presidents    and senior adviser and the top economic adviser gary d cohn but they may not be able to the president is said to be aware that a meaningful reconciliation will take work to achieve between mr bannon who sees himself as the keeper of mr trumps campaign promises and the competing ideologies of mr kushner and mr cohn a longtime wall street executive and a democrat and he is considering a   of his senior staff according to four people with direct knowledge of the process whether he acts on it remains to be seen mr trump has often pondered making changes for several weeks or even months before making them if he does at all he has a high tolerance for chaos and a unique gift for creating it     and despite his famous youre fired tagline from the show the apprentice an aversion to dismissing people but this past week one that some of his aides considered the best of his presidency was marred by fits starts and   wounds     and the constant churn of news accounts of a white house at war with itself finally wore the president out and notice of a possible   was a warning shot to his team to make adjustments a spokeswoman for mr trump sarah huckabee sanders insisted that such accounts were untrue once again this is a completely false story driven by people who want to distract from the success taking place in this administration she said in an emailed statement the presidents pick for the supreme court a decision that has generational impact was confirmed today we hosted multiple foreign leaders this week and the president took bold and decisive military action against syria last night the only thing we are shaking up is the way washington operates as we push the presidents aggressive agenda forward  but two people who have spoken with mr trump said he recognized that the continuing state of drama was unsustainable no changes are imminent they said but the president is considering a range of options including a shift in role for mr bannon who has become increasingly isolated in the white house as other power centers have grown as well as additional senior staff mr priebus has been a source of contention for a number of mr trumps former advisers with the president pushing back on criticism with the response that the former chairman of the republican national committee is a nice guy  mr bannon a     confidant of the presidents whose roving job in the white house has given him influence over policy and hiring decisions now finds himself in the undesirable position of being caught between the president and his family that is a position that others have not survived most notably corey lewandowski the first of the presidents three campaign managers mr bannon whose portfolio is broad but vague as a chief strategist has told people he believes mr kushners allies have undermined him that he has no plans to quit and is digging in for a fight one option being discussed is moving mr bannon to a different role his allies at an outside group supporting him run by his main benefactor the investor rebekah mercer have also discussed him joining them to provide strategy mr kushner  a government neophyte who has taken on a much larger portfolio as a top west wing aide and foreign envoy was said to be displeased after hearing that mr bannon made critical remarks about him to other aides and trump associates while he was in iraq recently mr bannon has told confidants that he believes mr kushners contact with russians and his expected testimony before congress on the subject will become a major distraction for the white house kushner allies have also raised the issue with the president of the increasingly unflattering coverage that mr kushner is receiving from breitbart news the   website that mr bannon used to run but mr bannon has his own core of supporters outside the white house and he has argued that mr kushners efforts to pull his    more to the center on issues like immigration would poison him with the conservative base     a hopeless position to be in because mr bannon believes so few democrats would ever consider supporting mr trump in the white house blame game no one is safe mr bannons team is blamed for the contested and controversial travel bans mr priebus was damaged by the failure of health care legislation mr kushner has yet to show he can master his own portfolio and his role is so large that miscues will be magnified mr trump does not like any staff member gaining too much attention including those who are related to him he had three campaign   in the  cycle and he tends to make changes based on instinct as he learns the job of a president his allies say he was destined to make such changes there is a long history of presidents making staff changes and one of mr trumps predecessors bill clinton made changes within the first six months of his administration newt gingrich an informal adviser to mr trump and a former house speaker said i think first of all a very high amount of tension in the white house is normal  i think they have particular tension right now because the health bill failed he added the stories about infighting probably bother him some mr gingrich said but do i think theyre damaging to his   prospects

       " 'former dea prescription head drops a bombshell  congress protects big pharma  fuels opioid crisis former dea prescription head drops a bombshell  congress protects big pharma  fuels opioid crisis   source claire bernish congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs says a former head of the dea responsible for preventing abuse of medications joseph rannazzisi former deputy assistant administrator at the us drug enforcement agency asserts big pharma and its lobbyists have a stranglehold on legislators in congress and have engineered the protection of a  billion per year industry over the health of american citizens according to a report from the guardian  congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive he said according to the outlet as long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists nothings going to change rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin  and helped limit the deas powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same a pharmacist himself rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard  publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industrys profits these congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for reelection its a sham he told the guardian  the congressmen and senators who are championing this fight the ones who really believe in what theyre doing their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence with the unique insight of having been an insider rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability and he would know according to rannazzisis linkedin profile as chief of diversion he had been tasked with oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately  million dea registrants but if the standards are lowered by congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids the threshold of criminality is raised as the guardian points out legislation to fight the opioid epidemic comprehensive addiction and recovery act  did in fact pass in july  but partisan controversy erupted when republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth democrats then issued a report titled  dying waiting for treatment  in response which likened the republican response to the opioid crisis to using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam indeed the report sharply criticized the bill equating its policies to empty promises for the lack of financial followthrough as the washington post detailed in a report earlier this month the dea launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal pill mills and corrupt pharmacies who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets headed by rannazzisi the office of diversion control sent investigators into the field and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets but the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry  fearing a potential significant loss in profits  fought back hard according to the post  the deputy attorney general summoned rannazzisi to a meeting in  concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies that meeting was to chastise me for going after industry and thats all that meeting was about the nowretired dea official told the post  then in  came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the department of justice and congressional legislators the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act  legislation initiated by the healthcare distribution management association  the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy an analysis of lobbying records by the post found the healthcare distribution alliance spent  million lobbying house and senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between  and  rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in july  and recalled telling them this bill passes the way its written we wont be able to get immediate suspension orders we wont be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations stunned at the massive  and ultimately successful  effort to take the bite out of dea attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take  lives every year rannazzisi likened the legislation to a free pass for legal drug pushers this doesnt ensure patient access and it doesnt help drug enforcement at all he told the guardian what this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process what this bill does is take away deas ability to go after a pharmacist a wholesaler manufacturer or distributor this was a gift a gift to the industry he added after heading the diversion office for a decade rannazzisi retired in   likely disgusted over legislators dedication to the legal drug industry rather than the people whose interests theyre ostensibly obligated to protect the bill passed because big pharma wanted it to pass he told the guardian in no uncertain terms the dea is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency when i was in charge what i tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyre not going to like being regulated big pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation as the center for public integrity found  the guardian noted purdue pharma  at the heart of the epidemic for its highlyaddictive drug introduced in the late s oxycontin  spent a breathtaking  million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts however big pharmas power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying  the governmentrun interagency pain research coordinating committee iprcc has been accused by sen ron wyden of being a tool to weaken cdc guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids wyden wrote to secretary of health and human services sylvia burwell of his concerns the iprcc had been staffed with experts with conflicts of interest for their close ties to big pharma including a scientist with a  million endowment from purdue reported the guardian  youve got a panel thats certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing thats something youve got to root out wyden asserted  the role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of big pharmas proopioid cash appalling  yet it continues to this day policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap bloodtainted profits corporations have no conscience rannazzisi flatly told the guardian  unfortunately with my job i was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids if one of those ceos went out there and talked to anybody or if one of those ceos happened to lose a kid to this horrible horrible domestic tragedy we have id bet you theyd change their mind when you sit with a parent who cant understand why theres so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace and why isnt the government doing anything well the dea was doing something unfortunately what were trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws share this
